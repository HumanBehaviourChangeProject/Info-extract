enhance the processing of the health information and are more likely to be read, remembered, and perceived as personally relevant..", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Additionally, past

reach large numbers of people.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Although Web-based computer-tailored smoking cessation interventions have been shown to be potentially effective, they often

completing all intervention elements and show a lower adherence toward these programs.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Because smokers with lower levels of education appear to be more

interventions and may attract and stimulate comprehension among low health literacy groups.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Because video-based information seems to require less mental

they maybe more attracted by text-based messages).", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Studies have already tested the effects of a combination of interactive components, such as graphics,

on the smoker's motivation to quit smoking.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "Until now, most computer-tailored smoking cessation interventions have been developed for smokers with high motivation to quit, whereas less-educated smokers often show lower motivation to quit and might benefit from interventions which give them the possibility and time to reflect on their smoking behavior

adapted to the needs of groups with different levels of education and should take the user's motivation to quit into account.", "labels": [], "entities": []}, {"text": "The study described in this
