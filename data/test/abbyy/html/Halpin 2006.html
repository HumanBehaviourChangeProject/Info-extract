<p class="font7" style="padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 217pt;">Dependence: Results from a Randomized Trial</p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">This research estimated the costs and effectiveness of three different benefit designs for treating tobacco dependence: drugs only (nicotine replacement therapy patch, nasal&nbsp;spray, inhaler, and Zyban); drugs and counseling (drugs and proactive telephone&nbsp;counseling); and drugs if counseling (drugs conditional on enrollment in counseling).&nbsp;A sample of 393 adult smokers enrolled in a California preferred provider organization&nbsp;was randomly assigned to one of three study groups. After eight months, there were no&nbsp;significant increases in quit attempts or quit rates in the groups with covered drugs and&nbsp;counseling compared to the group with drug coverage only. Therefore, costs rose with no&nbsp;increase in quit rates when proactive telephone counseling was added to coverage of&nbsp;pharmacotherapy, regardless of benefit design.</span></p>

<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">Tobacco use has been identified as the single, largest preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States; it leads to an estimated&nbsp;440,000 deaths and more than five million years&nbsp;of life lost each year (DHHS 2004). This places&nbsp;a huge burden on society, with an estimated total&nbsp;cost of $158 billion per year (DHHS 2004). This&nbsp;includes both the direct costs to the health care&nbsp;system from the treatment of tobacco-related illness (estimated at $82 billion per year), as well&nbsp;as the societal costs resulting from lost productivity of workers due to premature death and disease&nbsp;(estimated at $76 billion per year). In California,&nbsp;there are approximately 43,000 tobacco-related&nbsp;deaths each year, representing 535,000 years of&nbsp;life lost (Max et al. 2004). This translates into&nbsp;$8.6 billion in direct medical costs and $7.3 billion in lost productivity from illness and premature death (Max et al. 2004).</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Recent clinical practice guidelines identify effective treatments for tobacco use and dependence and recommend that all patients who use tobacco&nbsp;be offered at least one of these treatments to help&nbsp;them stop smoking (Fiore et al. 1996, 2000). The&nbsp;2000 U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) guideline&nbsp;recommends two types of treatment for tobacco&nbsp;dependence: pharmacotherapy and counseling&nbsp;services. The recommended first-line pharmacotherapy treatments include bupropion SR (Zyban)&nbsp;and all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&nbsp;approved nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)&nbsp;including gum, patch, nasal spray, inhaler, and&nbsp;lozenges. Effective counseling services identified&nbsp;in the guideline include proactive telephone counseling, individual face-to-face counseling, and&nbsp;group counseling services. In addition, the PHS&nbsp;guideline recommends that all health insurers&nbsp;provide coverage for these effective treatments.&nbsp;Health insurance coverage of recommended&nbsp;tobacco dependence treatments has been demonstrated to increase quit attempts, use of treatments,&nbsp;and quit rates (Curry, Grothaus, and McAfee&nbsp;1998; Schauffler et al. 2001a). However, the evidence reviewed in the PHS guideline examines&nbsp;only the effectiveness of each drug or counseling&nbsp;service independently and provides no evidence&nbsp;of the effect of combined pharmacotherapy and&nbsp;counseling or guidance on preferred benefit&nbsp;designs.</p><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">While there is widespread agreement in the field of tobacco control that health insurance&nbsp;should cover effective treatments for tobacco dependence, the optimal benefit design for covering&nbsp;these services remains uncertain. In 1999, a survey&nbsp;was conducted of all California health maintenance organizations (HMOs) to document theben-efit designs for tobacco dependence treatments&nbsp;offered in their standard employer group health&nbsp;plan benefit packages (Schauffler et al. 2001b).&nbsp;This study found that 31% of HMOs offered coverage for both pharmacotherapy and counseling,&nbsp;15% offered coverage for pharmacotherapy only,&nbsp;15% offered coverage for counseling only, and&nbsp;38% offered coverage for pharmacotherapy conditional on enrollment in a counseling program&nbsp;(Schauffler et al. 2001b). This mix of benefit designs offered in California HMOs raises questions&nbsp;regarding which design is optimal to most effectively and efficiently aid smoking cessation in an&nbsp;enrolled adult population.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;">Coverage for pharmacotherapy is more prevalent than coverage for behavioral programs to treat tobacco dependence in both the public and private&nbsp;sectors (McPhillips-Tangum et al. 2004; Halpin,&nbsp;McMenamin, and Keeler 2004). Therefore, two&nbsp;of the major questions facing both public and private policymakers are: 1) Is the effect of coverage&nbsp;for pharmacotherapy treatments enhanced if&nbsp;counseling services are also covered? 2) What is&nbsp;the effect of restricting coverage for pharmacotherapy to smokers who enroll in counseling? To&nbsp;this end, this research has four main objectives:&nbsp;1) to document changes in quitting behaviors&nbsp;among smokers in three treatment groups with different benefit designs (coverage for pharmacotherapy only, pharmacotherapy and counseling,&nbsp;and pharmacotherapy conditional on&nbsp;participation in counseling) with the same costsharing requirements; 2) to determine whether&nbsp;adding health insurance coverage for counseling&nbsp;to coverage for pharmacotherapy changes smoking cessation behaviors and outcomes; 3) to determine whether the specific design of the counseling&nbsp;and pharmacotherapy benefit (i.e., pharmacotherapy either conditional on enrollment in counseling&nbsp;programs or not) affects smoking cessation behaviors among adult smokers; and 4) to estimate the&nbsp;relative costs of achieving the major quitting outcomes for each benefit design. The goal of the&nbsp;study was to learn how best to design a package&nbsp;of tobacco dependence treatments for a group of&nbsp;insured adult smokers who are motivated to try&nbsp;to quit.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 5pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Study Design</span></p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">This case study was an eight-month randomized trial, conducted from May 1, 2001, through December 31, 2001, that compared three different&nbsp;health insurance benefit designs for tobacco dependence treatments. The three treatment groups&nbsp;were designed based on three benefit designs&nbsp;found in California HMOs (pharmacotherapy&nbsp;only, pharmacotherapy and counseling, and pharmacotherapy conditional on counseling) (Schauf-fler et al. 2001b). According to the findings of the&nbsp;2000 PHS clinical practice guideline, there is no&nbsp;statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of individual face-to-face, group, and proactive telephone counseling (Fiore et al. 2000).&nbsp;Proactive telephone counseling was chosen as&nbsp;the method of counseling for this study because&nbsp;it has been shown to have the highest participation rates compared to group counseling and&nbsp;face-to-face counseling, it is the most accessible&nbsp;of the three counseling formats, and it is the format of counseling most covered by health plans&nbsp;in the United States (McPhillips-Tangum et al.&nbsp;2004). Rates of participation in group counseling&nbsp;can be as low as 1% or less, while rates of participation in telephone counseling can be as high as&nbsp;10% to 25% (Schauffler et al. 2001a). In addition,&nbsp;the physicians in the preferred provider organization (PPO) in the study have not participated in&nbsp;any organized training for smoking cessation,&nbsp;and most physician offices do not have dedicated&nbsp;personnel to perform such counseling.</p></td></tr></table><hr>
<table cellpadding="5pt">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">While there is a considerable body of literature that demonstrates the efficacy of proactive telephone counseling compared to no interventions&nbsp;on quit attempts and quit rates (Fiore et al.&nbsp;2000; Stead, Lancaster, and Perera 2003), there&nbsp;is a growing body of literature evaluating the&nbsp;effectiveness of proactive telephone counseling&nbsp;as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy compared to&nbsp;pharmacotherapy alone (Stead, Lancaster, and&nbsp;Perera 2003; Ockene et al. 1991; Lando et al.&nbsp;1997; Reid, Pipe and Dafoe 1999; Solomon et al.&nbsp;2000). Four trials have not found any additional&nbsp;effect of telephone counseling for those who&nbsp;use nicotine replacement therapy (Stead, Lancaster, and Perera 2003), but none of these studies&nbsp;specifically evaluated the effect of different benefit designs on smoking cessation.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">To recruit participants for this study, informational postcards were mailed to all enrollees in the individual and family plans of a large preferred provider organization operating in California (n <span class="font1">= </span><span class="font5">113,000 PPO enrollees). This postcard&nbsp;invited smokers to participate in a research study&nbsp;on smoking cessation benefits, requiring them&nbsp;to complete telephone interviews and providing&nbsp;them with access to free or low-cost smoking cessation methods (the pharmacotherapy under all&nbsp;three benefit designs required a $15 co-pay, while&nbsp;the counseling did not require cost sharing). At&nbsp;the time of the study, this PPO offered cessation&nbsp;coverage for pharmacotherapy for enrollees in&nbsp;the group market, but did not provide coverage&nbsp;for any smoking cessation benefits to its individual and family plan members.</span></p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Those who responded to the mailing (n <span class="font1">= </span><span class="font5">803) were contacted by telephone to determine their&nbsp;eligibility and, if eligible, to conduct the baseline&nbsp;telephone survey. Those who were eligible and&nbsp;completed the baseline interview (71%) were&nbsp;mailed a packet including a complete description&nbsp;of the study, a self-help smoking cessation kit, information on any risks they might face as participants in the study, and two copies of a written&nbsp;consent form (one for their records and one to return to the study). Figure 1 illustrates the disposition of the sample from initial contact through&nbsp;the eight-month follow-up.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Study participants who completed the baseline interview and returned written consent forms&nbsp;(69%) were randomized into three treatment&nbsp;groups. The control group (drugs only, <span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> =&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">126) received tobacco dependence treatment coverage for pharmacotherapy only; the pharmacotherapy included coverage for Zyban and NRT&nbsp;patch, inhaler, and nasal spray.<sup>1</sup> The second&nbsp;group (drugs and counseling, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">n =</span><span class="font5"> 140) received&nbsp;tobacco dependence treatment coverage for the&nbsp;aforementioned pharmacotherapy in addition to&nbsp;coverage for proactive telephone counseling provided through a nationally recognized program.&nbsp;The third group (drugs if counseling, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">n =</span><span class="font5"> 127) received tobacco dependence treatment coverage&nbsp;for proactive telephone counseling and coverage&nbsp;for pharmacotherapy only if they enrolled in the&nbsp;telephone counseling program. The proportion&nbsp;of subjects lost to follow-up at eight months&nbsp;was 18%; the proportion completing the study&nbsp;was 82%. However, all multivariate analyses included 100% of the original sample in each study&nbsp;group using an intent-to-treat model. All research&nbsp;was conducted with prior approval from, and in&nbsp;accordance with the guidelines set forth by, the&nbsp;Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects&nbsp;at the University of California, Berkeley.</span></p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Study participants were under no obligation to use any of the tobacco dependence treatments&nbsp;covered under the study, and they were free to&nbsp;use these benefits just as they would any other&nbsp;covered services. Access to pharmacotherapy&nbsp;benefits required a prescription. Enrollment in&nbsp;the proactive telephone counseling program required calling a toll-free number to register.&nbsp;During the first call, the phone specialist used&nbsp;a formal protocol to assess the smoker’s nicotine&nbsp;dependence, readiness to quit, motivation to use&nbsp;behavioral techniques, and self-efficacy regarding cessation.<sup>2</sup> A quitting plan was developed&nbsp;and telephone follow-up calls were scheduled&nbsp;for one year (during which the participant received four additional calls). If the participant&nbsp;relapsed, s/he was sent a ‘‘recycle kit’’ and the&nbsp;specialist re-initiated the quitting process.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Baseline and eight-month follow-up data on smoking and quitting behaviors for all participants were collected by telephone using a computer-administered telephone interview (CATI)&nbsp;system. Participants received $5 for each telephone interview that they completed. Reminder&nbsp;postcards were sent at the midpoint of the study&nbsp;to remind participants of their eligible benefits&nbsp;and to inform them that they had four more&nbsp;months of eligibility.

<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 19pt 0pt;">Thus, the results from this case study are only generalizable to smokers enrolled in individual&nbsp;and family PPOs in the private health insurance&nbsp;market; their applicability to smokers enrolled&nbsp;in other types of health plans is not known. We&nbsp;found several differences between our study participants and a population-based data set of&nbsp;smokers insured in HMOs and PPOs in California.<sup>3</sup> First, the smokers in our study were more&nbsp;likely to be female and more likely to be white&nbsp;than the population of California smokers. And&nbsp;while the smokers in our study were more likely&nbsp;to report wanting to stop smoking and contemplating quitting in the next month, they were actually less likely to have made a quit attempt in&nbsp;the last year and were no more likely to be planning on quitting in the next month compared&nbsp;to all California smokers. We do not know the&nbsp;extent to which these differences are the result&nbsp;of differences in smokers enrolled in individual&nbsp;and family plan PPOs compared to other types&nbsp;of managed care plans, or the result of differences&nbsp;between those who volunteered to be part of a&nbsp;smoking cessation study and the general population of smokers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 5pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Main Outcome Measures</span></p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">The primary outcomes of interest were: making a quit attempt (stopped smoking for one or more&nbsp;days during the study because they were trying to&nbsp;quit and not for some other reason), quitting during the study (stopped smoking for seven or more&nbsp;days in a row during the study because they were&nbsp;trying to quit and not for some other reason), and&nbsp;prevalent abstinence (had not smoked a cigarette&nbsp;for seven or more days in a row at the eight-month follow-up interview). A second outcome&nbsp;was the total cost of coverage of tobacco dependence treatments under the three different benefit&nbsp;designs and the standardized cost per quitting outcome. Additional outcomes of interest included&nbsp;utilization of the pharmacotherapy benefits and&nbsp;participation in the proactive telephone counseling program.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 19pt 0pt;">Data on quitting behaviors were collected by self-report in the follow-up telephone survey.&nbsp;Data on filled prescriptions were provided by&nbsp;the pharmacy manager of the participating PPO&nbsp;to confirm self-reported use of pharmacotherapy&nbsp;benefits for each participant and for estimating&nbsp;the cost of pharmacotherapy coverage for each&nbsp;group. Data confirming participant enrollment&nbsp;in the covered proactive telephone counseling&nbsp;program were provided by a contact at that program and used for estimating the cost of telephone counseling coverage for each group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 5pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Statistical Analysis</span></p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">For all demographic and control variables, proportions were estimated for the full sample and for each study group. The full sample included&nbsp;those respondents who were lost to follow-up between the baseline and follow-up surveys. Using&nbsp;an intent-to-treat model, these respondents were&nbsp;assumed not to have made a quit attempt, not to&nbsp;have quit during the study period, and not to have&nbsp;prevalent abstinence at eight months. Chi-square&nbsp;tests were performed to estimate whether there&nbsp;were any statistically significant differences in&nbsp;the characteristics of the three study groups at&nbsp;baseline. Bivariate analysis using the chi-square&nbsp;test also was conducted to analyze the associations between treatment group and each outcome&nbsp;measure.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Logistic regression models were estimated for each of the major outcomes of interest to assess&nbsp;the independent association of the two treatment&nbsp;groups covering counseling with each outcome&nbsp;using the ‘‘drugs only” group as the referent&nbsp;group. The models were run controlling for:&nbsp;1) smoking characteristics at baseline (made&nbsp;a quit attempt in lifetime, number of cigarettes&nbsp;smoked per day, age started smoking regularly,&nbsp;stage of readiness to quit, used drugs in a prior&nbsp;quit attempt, prior use of Wellbutrin for nonsmoking related diagnosis), 2) demographic characteristics (age, gender, income, race), and 3)&nbsp;doctor visit during the study period. These variables were selected based on previous research on&nbsp;the determinants of quitting smoking (Kabat and&nbsp;Wynder 1987; DHHS 1990). The doctor visit&nbsp;variable measured any doctor visit. While individual doctors were not informed regarding&nbsp;which of their patients were participating in the&nbsp;study, prior research finds that more than half&nbsp;of all doctors in California advise their patients&nbsp;to quit smoking during an office visit. Thus it&nbsp;was important to control for physician contact&nbsp;over the study period.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;padding:0pt 0pt 16pt 0pt;">Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from the coefficients in the logistic models. Costs of treatment for each&nbsp;group were estimated based on utilization of the&nbsp;treatments and the costs of each covered drug&nbsp;(for a 12-week course of treatment) to the PPO,&nbsp;the cost of enrollment in the proactive telephone&nbsp;counseling program, and the cost of the self-help&nbsp;kit sent to all study participants.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 5pt 0pt;"><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Results</span></h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 5pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Randomization and Demographics</span></p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 16pt 0pt;">For all demographic, smoking, and control variables, there were no statistically significant differences across the three groups with the exception of income level (Table 1). The drugs and counseling group reported lower incomes compared to&nbsp;the other two study groups, although the participants as a whole had relatively high incomes, reflecting their ability to purchase health insurance&nbsp;in the private individual market. Upon further&nbsp;examination, it appears that this observed difference is a purely random result. The study&nbsp;participants were predominantly white (90%),&nbsp;female (66%), age 40 or older (67%), and&nbsp;smoked less than one pack of cigarettes per day&nbsp;(84%). They were also a highly motivated group&nbsp;with good access to the health care system, with&nbsp;94% reporting that they would like to stop smoking, 86% having made at least one quit attempt in&nbsp;their lifetime, and 19% reporting using medication in their most recent quit attempt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 5pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Outcomes</span></p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">A simple bivariate analysis of quitting outcomes by treatment group found no statistically significant differences across the groups in quit attempts, quit rates during the study, or prevalent&nbsp;abstinence rates at eight months (Table 2). The&nbsp;average rate of making a quit attempt across all&nbsp;groups was 48%, ranging from 43% to 55%. Quit&nbsp;rates during the study averaged 31% across all&nbsp;groups, ranging from 26% to 37%. Prevalent&nbsp;abstinence rates at eight months averaged 16%&nbsp;across all groups, ranging from 13% to 19%.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">In addition, utilization of the pharmacotherapy benefit did not vary across treatment groups. On&nbsp;average, 20% of subjects filled a prescription for&nbsp;one of the covered medications, with essentially&nbsp;no variation observed across the three study&nbsp;groups. This pattern held true for Zyban (11%),&nbsp;the NRT patch (8%), and NRT nasal spray or&nbsp;inhaler (4%). However, for the two treatment&nbsp;groups for which proactive telephone counseling&nbsp;was covered, statistically significant differences&nbsp;were observed in enrollment in the proactive telephone counseling program. While 8% of the subjects in the drugs and counseling group enrolled in&nbsp;telephone counseling, approximately three times&nbsp;as many subjects in the drugs if counseling group&nbsp;(24%) enrolled in the telephone counseling.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">When we examined multiple treatment use among participants in the two study groups&nbsp;who had coverage for counseling in addition to&nbsp;drugs, we found that few chose only counseling.&nbsp;In the drugs and counseling group, of the 34 subjects who used any treatment, 30 chose to use&nbsp;drugs; four chose only counseling. This pattern&nbsp;is similar in the drugs if counseling group; of&nbsp;the 29 subjects who signed up for counseling,&nbsp;just seven used only counseling. In effect, fewer&nbsp;than 3% of the sample across all three study&nbsp;groups used counseling only.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Differences in the characteristics of smokers who did and did not use the covered treatments&nbsp;over the course of the trial suggest that smokers&nbsp;who used covered treatments were more likely:&nbsp;to have been at a higher stage of readiness to quit&nbsp;(planning to quit), to have visited a physician in&nbsp;the past year, and to have reported using drugs&nbsp;in a previous quit attempt (Table 3). In contrast,&nbsp;those who did not use any covered treatments&nbsp;were more likely to report that they did not want&nbsp;to quit and that they were in the pre-contemplation&nbsp;stage of readiness. No differences were observed&nbsp;in the groups who did and did not use covered&nbsp;treatments as measured by age, gender, income&nbsp;and race, or by number of cigarettes smoked&nbsp;per day, age started smoking regularly, if they&nbsp;had ever made a quit attempt in their lifetime,&nbsp;and their use of Wellbutrin prior to the study&nbsp;period.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">We also were interested in knowing whether certain smokers preferred one type of treatment&nbsp;over the other and what characteristics were</p></td></tr></table><hr>

This exception was the drugs and counseling group, which had lower odds of making a quit&nbsp;attempt compared to the drugs only group.</p>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;">Previous studies have examined the effects of telephone counseling as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy on cessation rates. This case study, however, represents the first randomized trial to&nbsp;assess the effects of different benefit designs that&nbsp;add health insurance coverage of proactive telephone counseling services to pharmacotherapy&nbsp;coverage for treating tobacco dependence on&nbsp;the use of covered services, quitting outcomes,&nbsp;and benefit costs. The findings presented here&nbsp;in the context of a health insurance benefit design&nbsp;are consistent with the previously published studies, which find that the addition of proactive telephone counseling to pharmacotherapy does not&nbsp;positively impact smoking cessation practices&nbsp;and quit rates compared to pharmacotherapy&nbsp;alone (Stead, Lancaster, and Perera 2003; Ock-ene et al. 1991; Lando et al. 1997; Reid, Pipe,&nbsp;and Dafoe 1999; Solomon et al. 2000). In addition, this is the first study to examine two&nbsp;different benefit designs for covering both pharmacotherapy and counseling to treat tobacco dependence. The results from this study show that&nbsp;although there was an increase in use of proactive&nbsp;telephone counseling among those in the drugs if&nbsp;counseling group, this group did not have any&nbsp;higher quit rates compared to the group with unlinked counseling and pharmacotherapy benefits.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">There are three major findings from this case study that are particularly noteworthy. The first&nbsp;is that adding coverage for proactive telephone&nbsp;counseling to coverage for pharmacotherapy for&nbsp;treating tobacco dependence did not increase quit&nbsp;attempts or quit rates among adult smokers. The&nbsp;second is that linking access to drugs to counseling by restricting drug coverage to those enrolled&nbsp;in proactive telephone counseling did not act as&nbsp;a barrier to use of these medications or as a complement that enhanced the effect of the drugs.&nbsp;Regardless of benefit design, the rates of use of&nbsp;Zyban, the nicotine patch, and nicotine nasal&nbsp;spray did not vary across the three treatment&nbsp;groups. The third finding is that the cost of&nbsp;adding coverage for telephone counseling to&nbsp;a pharmacotherapy benefit was substantial, increasing the costs approximately twofold to&nbsp;achieve each major quitting outcome. Coverage&nbsp;for pharmacotherapy only was clearly the most&nbsp;efficient benefit design for treating tobacco&nbsp;dependence, achieving similar outcomes at a&nbsp;lower cost.</p></td></tr></table><hr>
<table cellpadding="5pt">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">The first major finding raises serious questions about the policies adopted by employers or&nbsp;health plans to add coverage for proactive telephone counseling services to treat tobacco dependence if pharmacotherapy (Zyban and NRT) is&nbsp;covered. In fact, our trial found that quit attempts&nbsp;were lower in the group that received unlinked&nbsp;drug and telephone counseling benefits and no&nbsp;different in the group that received linked telephone counseling benefits compared to those&nbsp;who received coverage for drugs only. In addition, even though the smokers in the treatment&nbsp;group with linked drug and counseling benefits&nbsp;enrolled in the proactive telephone counseling&nbsp;at nearly three times the rate compared to the&nbsp;treatment group with unlinked drug and counseling benefits, there were still no differences observed for these two groups in quit attempts or&nbsp;quit rates compared to the drugs only group after&nbsp;eight months.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">The second finding is that, at least for proactive telephone counseling, requiring enrollment in&nbsp;counseling in order to obtain drug coverage does&nbsp;not deter smokers from getting prescriptions for&nbsp;covered tobacco dependence medications. The&nbsp;rates at which smokers filled prescriptions for&nbsp;Zyban and the nicotine patch or nasal spray were&nbsp;no different for those smokers who had to first&nbsp;sign up for telephone counseling compared to&nbsp;those who did not. Many employers and health&nbsp;plans currently structure their smoking cessation&nbsp;benefits such that access to covered pharmacotherapy is linked to enrollment in counseling&nbsp;(Schauffler, Mordavsky, and McMenamin 2001b).&nbsp;There are at least two possible objectives for such&nbsp;policies. The first is the belief that quit rates will</p></td>

<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">These findings indicate that employers and health plans may achieve a significant impact&nbsp;on quitting behaviors and smoking rates at a relatively low cost by covering pharmacotherapy&nbsp;only. Our results suggest that rather than adding&nbsp;coverage for proactive telephone counseling to&nbsp;a pharmacotherapy benefit, health care dollars&nbsp;may be more efficiently used if only pharmacotherapy is covered. In addition, employers and&nbsp;health plans may want to cover proactive telephone counseling, but only for those smokers&nbsp;for whom pharmacotherapy is not medically indicated or desired; research studies and metaanalyses have found that proactive telephone&nbsp;counseling interventions alone statistically significantly increase the odds of quitting smoking&nbsp;over less intensive treatments or no treatment&nbsp;(Fiore et al. 2000; Stead, Lancaster, and Perera&nbsp;2003; Borland et al. 2001). However, the literature to date and the results of this study do not inform the question of whether adding coverage for&nbsp;face-to-face counseling by a health care provider&nbsp;to a pharmacotherapy benefit increases quit and&nbsp;abstinence rates. Additional research is needed&nbsp;to address this question.</p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">An alternative to coverage for employers and health plans that want to provide access to counseling services, particularly for those smokers&nbsp;who cannot or do not want to use pharmacotherapy, is to refer them to a state telephone quit line&nbsp;to receive counseling services. In 2003, 34 states&nbsp;offered counseling services through a toll-free telephone quit line to assist smokers in their cessation&nbsp;attempts (Center for Tobacco Cessation 2004).</p><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">In light of the heterogeneity of tobacco dependence treatment benefit designs that are offered in practice today, it is important that employers and&nbsp;health plans take into account the relative impacts&nbsp;of different benefit designs for smoking cessation&nbsp;to most efficiently and effectively increase quit&nbsp;attempts and quit rates, and ultimately improve&nbsp;the overall health status of their populations.&nbsp;Our findings add to the growing body of literature&nbsp;on tobacco dependence treatment indicating that&nbsp;it is a drug benefit which produces the observed&nbsp;increases in quit attempts and quit rates at the&nbsp;lowest cost to employers and health plans, with&nbsp;no value added by covering proactive telephone&nbsp;counseling (Stead, Lancaster, and Perera 2003),&nbsp;regardless of benefit design, when Zyban and&nbsp;nicotine replacement therapy are covered.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Finally, these findings suggest that national guidelines for tobacco dependence treatments&nbsp;need to be updated and revised to address the&nbsp;effectiveness of combined therapies. The 2000&nbsp;PHS clinical practice guideline was silent on&nbsp;the effectiveness of treatments combining&nbsp;pharmacotherapy and counseling. At present,&nbsp;more than half of the Medicaid programs and&nbsp;health maintenance organizations in the United&nbsp;States cover treatments for tobacco dependence&nbsp;(McPhillips-Tangum et al. 2004; Halpin,&nbsp;McMenamin, and Keeler 2004). The continued&nbsp;development of both public and private health&nbsp;insurance benefits for smoking cessation would&nbsp;be greatly aided by a comprehensive review of&nbsp;the evidence of the effectiveness of combined&nbsp;pharmacotherapy and counseling services. This&nbsp;is particularly important given pressures to&nbsp;control rising health care costs. It is in the interests of employers, health plans, and state and&nbsp;federal governments to design cost-effective&nbsp;benefits that achieve desired outcomes at the&nbsp;lowest cost.</p></td></tr></table><hr>

Its&nbsp;mechanism of action is presumed to be mediated&nbsp;through its capacity to block the re-uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine centrally. It is available as&nbsp;Zyban (used for smoking cessation) or Wellbutrin&nbsp;(used for depression). Nicotine replacement therapy&nbsp;refers to a medication containing nicotine that is&nbsp;intended to promote smoking cessation. There are&nbsp;four nicotine replacement therapy delivery systems&nbsp;currently approved for use in the United States.&nbsp;These include nicotine chewing gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine patch, and nicotine nasal spray.&nbsp;The side effects, dosages, duration, and availability&nbsp;of the pharmaceuticals used in this study are as&nbsp;follows:</p></li></ul></td>
