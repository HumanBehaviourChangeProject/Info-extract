<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 0pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Background and objective. </span><span class="font2">GPs are an important source of smoking cessation advice. This research examined whether a model encouraging GP referral of patients who smoke to a specialist service would be acceptable and effective for increased smoking cessation when compared with&nbsp;a model of in-practice management.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 0pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Methods. </span><span class="font2">The study design was cluster randomized controlled trial. Practices were randomized to one of two interventions, at a rate of 1:2: (i) standard in-practice GP management or (ii) referral&nbsp;to a quitline service. The main outcome measures were sustained abstinence of </span><span class="font6">&gt;</span><span class="font2">1 month&nbsp;duration at 3-month follow-up and </span><span class="font6">&gt;</span><span class="font2">10 months duration at 12 months, using intention to treat&nbsp;analysis.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 0pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Results. </span><span class="font2">At 3-month follow-up, patients in the referral condition were twice as likely to report sustained abstinence than those in the in-practice condition [12.3% compared with 6.9%; odds&nbsp;ratio (OR) </span><span class="font6">= </span><span class="font2">1.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-3.13]. At 12-month follow-up, patients in&nbsp;the referral condition had nearly three times the odds of sustained abstinence [6.5% compared&nbsp;with 2.6%; OR </span><span class="font6">= </span><span class="font2">2.86 (95% CI 0.94-8.71)]. The intervention effect was mediated by the amount of&nbsp;help received outside the practice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 0pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusions. </span><span class="font2">This research provided evidence that GPs referring smokers to an evidence-based quitline service results in increased cessation. The benefit is largely due to patients in the referral&nbsp;condition receiving more external help than patients in the in-practice condition, as they received&nbsp;equivalent practice-based help. Where suitable services exist, we recommend that referral become the normative strategy for management of smoking cessation in general practice to complement any practice-based help provided.</span></p>

<p class="font6">GPs have a responsibility to indicate the harms associated with smoking to their patients who smoke, and where possible to encourage and support them to quit.</p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 4pt 0pt;">Brief counselling (as little as 3 minutes duration) from a GP can substantially increase quit rates, with&nbsp;effectiveness increasing at higher levels of intensity.<sup>1,2</sup></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;">The major effect is to help motivate a quit attempt.<sup>3 </sup>Nonetheless, GP engagement in helping patients to&nbsp;quit remains limited. Systemic barriers that continue&nbsp;to inhibit the routine delivery of cessation counselling&nbsp;include perceived lack of effect, reluctance to raise&nbsp;the issue due to patient sensitivity about smoking, lack&nbsp;of time and inadequate training.<sup>4-6</sup> In Australia, two&nbsp;pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation (bupropion&nbsp;and varenicline) are available only on prescription, but&nbsp;not routinely prescribed to patients who smoke. Both&nbsp;are eligible for reimbursement via the Pharmaceutical&nbsp;Benefits Scheme, meaning a complete course can be&nbsp;purchased for around AUD$60 (around 40 Euro).</p><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">

<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">To promote physician involvement, several countries, including Australia, have developed evidence-based&nbsp;clinical guidelines for the treatment of tobacco dependence in general practice. An important innovation in&nbsp;the Australian guidelines<sup>3</sup> is the offer of two evidencebased strategies for providing cessation assistance:&nbsp;within the consultation and/or referral to specialist cessation services. In Australia, the main available service&nbsp;is the network of state-based quitlines that provide callback counselling and other forms of cessation support.</p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">GPs can either encourage their smoking patients to contact the quitline service directly or can use fax referral forms that prompt a phone call to their patients&nbsp;from a trained quitline advisor. For referrals, the quitline calls the smoker and discusses options for assistance, which allows callers to be directed to or offered&nbsp;the most appropriate form of support.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Currently, it is not known whether encouraging referral (to quitline) will result in improved outcomes. In this research, we focussed on two services from the&nbsp;range provided by the Victorian Quitline: callback&nbsp;counselling and the QuitCoach, an internet-delivered,&nbsp;automated personalized advice programme. Both callback counselling in general<sup>8</sup> and the Victorian service<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>are demonstrably effective. Similarly, telehealth strategies can be effective,<sup>10</sup> with the QuitCoach being&nbsp;one example.<sup>11</sup> These services have a number of advantages over face-to-face cessation counselling,&nbsp;namely convenience, accessibility and making multiple&nbsp;contacts easier<sup>7</sup>; however, this does not guarantee that&nbsp;the contacts will occur.</p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">This is a study of the effectiveness of two management strategies, not a study of the effectiveness of the interventions used <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per se.</span><span class="font6"> The objectives of the study&nbsp;were as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">(i) To investigate the relative effectiveness of inpractice GP management versus referral for increasing&nbsp;smoking cessation and</p></li><li>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 35pt 0pt;">(ii) To determine whether any benefits of one approach over the other was a function of the amount of&nbsp;assistance provided to the patient.</p></li></ul>
<h3 style="padding:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;"><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Methods</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Study design</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">A two-group cluster randomized controlled trial with GPs randomized on a ratio of 1:2 to in-practice management or referral to the quitline service to maximize&nbsp;capacity to explore effects of use of Quitline’s&nbsp;different services. GPs were randomized by computer&nbsp;prior to their attendance at an education session during which they consented to participate in the study,&nbsp;completed a baseline survey, were informed of the&nbsp;condition to which they had been assigned and received training in either referral or in-practice management depending on their allocation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Participants</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;">Between September 2004 and December 2005, 45 primary care physicians (30 referral, 15 in-practice) recruited an average of 23.1 patients (SD 12.6, range 3-52, equivalent by condition: <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font6"> = 0.79). GP recruitment was undertaken using a range of strategies, described in McKay-Brown </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font6"> ,<sup>12</sup> resulting in a diverse&nbsp;sample. Of note, 69 GP practices were initially randomized but 24 failed to recruit (13 referral, 11 inpractice). Patients who presented for any reason who&nbsp;were current smokers (age </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&gt;</span><span class="font6"> 18 years), spoke English&nbsp;and were able to provide informed consent were eligible for recruitment. GPs, or preferably, their practice&nbsp;staff, were asked to recruit all eligible patients and record both refusals and failures to invite. Practices were&nbsp;paid $20 per recruited patient and GPs received Quality Assurance and Continuing Professional Development (QA&amp;CPD) points for participating. Additional&nbsp;QA&amp;CPD points were available if GPs concurrently&nbsp;audited their smoking cessation activities.<sup>12</sup></span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Overall, 1039 smokers were recruited: 728 (70.1%) to the referral condition and 311 (29.9%) to the in-practice condition. This was less than the target sample size&nbsp;of 1520 from 45 GPs based on an effect size of 5% over&nbsp;a baseline of 5% sustained abstinence with an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.013. Difficulties in recruiting and motivating GPs,<sup>12</sup> resulting in increased&nbsp;costs, required premature termination of recruitment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Measures</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;">GPs completed a questionnaire on number of years in practice, practice characteristics, prior training in the&nbsp;provision of smoking cessation assistance and the ease&nbsp;with which they had previously raised the issue of&nbsp;smoking cessation with patients.</p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">At baseline, patients completed a paper questionnaire that asked about current smoking behaviour, quitting history, the presence of existing co-morbidities, as well as basic demographic information (age and gender). The square root of daily cigarette consumption&nbsp;minus the natural logarithm of time to first cigarette of&nbsp;the day was used as the index of nicotine dependence&nbsp;(Heaviness of Smoking Index-alternate version).<sup>13</sup></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Three- and 12-month questionnaires were administered as computer-assisted telephone interviews by trained interviewers who were blind to treatment condition until after the outcome data were collected.&nbsp;Both surveys ascertained smoking status. Quitters&nbsp;were asked about length of time quit, any slip-ups and&nbsp;a single-item measure of frequency of strong cravings&nbsp;to smoke. Continuing smokers were asked about cigarette consumption and any quit attempts made since&nbsp;the baseline survey.</p></td></tr></table><hr>
<table cellpadding="10pt">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">The 3-month questionnaire also included (after outcome data were collected) specific questions about process, including extent of interaction with the GP,&nbsp;types of help offered and accepted by the patient and&nbsp;use of pharmacotherapy for cessation. Of particular&nbsp;interest was the amount of assistance received, including patients’ exposure to and experience of the services provided by the Victorian Quitline. Additional&nbsp;demographic information (e.g. household composition,&nbsp;employment status) was also collected.</p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">For those unable to be interviewed at 3 months, the 12-month survey was adapted, where relevant, to&nbsp;cover the longer period between surveys and to estimate smoking status at 3 months.</p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Procedures</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Participant recruitment was conducted by the GP in 28 practices (62%), in 12 (27%) by a combination of GP&nbsp;and practice staff and in 5 (11%) by practice staff only. This deviated from the original protocol.<sup>12</sup> Method&nbsp;of patient recruitment did not differ by condition (P =&nbsp;0.79). Those conducting recruitment were instructed&nbsp;to ask all patients who smoke whether they would be&nbsp;interested in participating. Patients read and signed&nbsp;a consent form and completed a one-page baseline&nbsp;questionnaire. They were informed that their decision&nbsp;to participate or not would have no implications for&nbsp;care provided by their GP. GPs were not blind to&nbsp;treatment condition. Participating patients consented&nbsp;to participate in the research; acceptance of any intervention was treated entirely as a clinical issue.</p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Treatment conditions</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;">In both treatment conditions, GPs were instructed to adhere to standard expectations of care outlined in&nbsp;the National Guidelines, including a brief assessment&nbsp;of readiness to quit and, if relevant, to deal with use&nbsp;of pharmacotherapy. At this point, the expected interventions diverged.</p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">GPs allocated to the in-practice management condition were encouraged to provide smokers with additional information and help to stop smoking, either personally or through other practice staff. They were&nbsp;not precluded from recommending external assistance&nbsp;or indeed from referring patients to the quitline, if this&nbsp;was their clinical preference.</p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">In the referral condition, GPs were encouraged to offer smokers with any interest in quitting referral to&nbsp;the Victorian Quitline. Patients who consented had&nbsp;their referral faxed to the quitline and were provided&nbsp;with a brochure on quitline services. The patient then&nbsp;received an introductory call from the quitline, generally within 2-3 days. Those unable to be reached by&nbsp;telephone were sent a brief letter notifying them of&nbsp;the failure and inviting them to call. When contact&nbsp;was made, the quitline advisor determined the patient’s interest in discussing their smoking, discussed&nbsp;treatment options and encouraged the smoker to&nbsp;choose the most appropriate service for them. Decisions not to accept a service were respected.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">The callback service offers up to two pre-quitting and four post-quitting telephone counselling sessions&nbsp;delivered by trained smoking cessation counsellors.&nbsp;Callbacks are scheduled in consultation with the client, but typically follow the relapse-sensitive schedule&nbsp;recommended by Zhu <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> The QuitCoach is an internet-delivered, interactive, multisession automated&nbsp;advice programme. Users complete a brief smoking&nbsp;assessment in order to obtain tailored cessation advice,&nbsp;and reassessments are encouraged through email&nbsp;prompts. It is designed to be used on multiple occasions,&nbsp;guiding the user through the process of smoking cessation. The QuitCoach is described in greater detail in&nbsp;Balmford, Borland and Benda.<sup>15</sup> Both of the quitline&nbsp;services provided email feedback to GPs on patients’&nbsp;acceptance and use of services and on their quitting outcomes to facilitate ongoing patient management.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Measures</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Outcome measures.</span><span class="font6"> The primary outcomes were sustained abstinence, defined as abstinence at the point of follow-up of &gt;1 month at 3-month follow-up and&nbsp;&gt;10 months at 12 months. The secondary outcomes&nbsp;were 24-hour point prevalence abstinence at both&nbsp;end points. Three sets of analyses were conducted:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;">(i) using only empirically established outcomes, regardless of uptake of intervention (intention to treat);</p></li><li>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">(ii) imputing 3-month outcome where possible from&nbsp;12-month data; and (iii) a conservative analysis, in&nbsp;which all missing cases were coded as treatment failures (i.e. smokers). Reviews confirm the accuracy of&nbsp;self-report measures and conclude that biochemical&nbsp;validation of smoking status is unnecessary in trials&nbsp;where there is no strong association between the interviewer and respondent.<sup>16</sup></p></li></ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Process measures.</span><span class="font6"> External behavioural help was defined as having received callback counselling or used the QuitCoach at least once, or attended a face-to-face&nbsp;cessation programme, by 3-month follow-up. In addition, we computed a measure of combined behavioural help/pharmacotherapy use (intensive assistance).&nbsp;Participants were coded as having received intensive&nbsp;assistance if they had accessed a quitline service, used&nbsp;pharmacotherapy, or both, in the first 3 months postrecruitment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Data analysis.</span><span class="font6"> Statistical analyses were performed with Stata, controlling for practice as a clustering variable. An alpha level of 0.05 was used for all statistical&nbsp;tests. In order to take into account the correlated nature of the data and repeated measures over time, generalized estimating equations were used for a final&nbsp;analysis of outcomes.<sup>17</sup> We assumed an exchangeable&nbsp;correlation structure. Robust (or empirical) variance&nbsp;was used to compute the P-values for the parameter&nbsp;estimates.<sup>18</sup> Mediated regression analyses were also&nbsp;conducted to explore the possible mechanism of the&nbsp;treatment effect.<sup>19</sup> The primary analyses used intention to treat, but we conducted subsidiary analyses using a conservative analysis of all cases with those&nbsp;missing outcome data assumed to be smoking.</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;">There were no significant differences in demographic or practice-related variables between GPs allocated to&nbsp;the referral and in-practice conditions.</p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 16pt 0pt;">Overall, 55.3% of participants were female and the average age was 40.7 years (SD 13.7). Table 1 presents&nbsp;the baseline demographic and smoking characteristics&nbsp;of the patient sample by condition. No significant differences were observed.</p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Participant retention</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">At 3 months, data were obtained from 74.1% (n = 771) of patients: 547 (75.1%) in the referral condition&nbsp;and 224 (72%) in the in-practice condition. A retention rate of 66.3% (n = 690) was achieved at 12-month&nbsp;follow-up: 495 (67.2%) in the referral and 195 (61.9%)&nbsp;in the in-practice condition. Attrition did not differ by&nbsp;condition at either 3- or 12-month follow-up (<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font6"> = 0.51&nbsp;and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font6"> = 0.28, respectively).</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;">Three-month outcomes were imputed (blind to condition) from the 12-month surveys of 79 cases. Those who reported having been quit for a sustained period&nbsp;of 9 months or more were imputed to have been point&nbsp;prevalence quit at 3 months, else they were imputed&nbsp;to have been smoking. Including the imputed cases,&nbsp;the 3-month sample was 850 (81.7% of the original&nbsp;sample). The retention rate in the increased sample&nbsp;did not differ by condition (<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font6"> = 0.29). Figure 1 illustrates the flow of patients through the study.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Amount of help received</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;">Participants in the in-practice condition were no more likely than those in the referral condition to recall&nbsp;having received in-practice cessation assistance (see&nbsp;Table 2). A marginally greater proportion of participants in the referral condition rated the advice provided&nbsp;by their GP as ‘very helpful’ compared with in-practice&nbsp;participants (54.1% and 43.8%, respectively, <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font6"> = 0.10).</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Just under half of all patients (47.5%, <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 366) reported having been referred to the quitline. All but 11 of these were in the referral condition (i.e. 78.1% of&nbsp;this group). Most referred patients (76.8%, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 281)&nbsp;were able to be contacted by the quitline, and of those&nbsp;contacted, almost three-quarters (73.5%, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 206) accepted an intensive service.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">As can be seen in Table 2, 25.3% (<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 195) of participants reported receiving external behavioural help, mainly the callback counselling. As expected, participants in the referral condition were more likely to&nbsp;receive external behavioural help (P &lt; 0.01). At&nbsp;3-month follow-up, 24% overall (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font6"> = 185) reported&nbsp;having used some form of pharmacotherapy.

<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;">At 3-month follow-up, 50.7% <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(n</span><span class="font6"> = 391) reported having made a quit attempt since baseline, more in the referral condition (53%) than in the in-practice condition (46%, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font6"> = 0.07).</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Table 3 shows outcome data by condition at the 3- and 12-month follow-up (controlling for age, gender and baseline nicotine dependence). The unadjusted results were&nbsp;similar although the effects were slightly weaker. At&nbsp;3 months, patients in the referral condition were approximately twice as likely to have achieved point prevalence&nbsp;as those in the in-practice condition. Using the conservative analysis (with missing data coded as smokers), a similar pattern of results was found. Removing the cases with&nbsp;imputed data also did not change this pattern.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;">Similar results were found at both follow-up points for sustained abstinence (see Table 3); however, the&nbsp;12-month result was not significant (just failed to reach&nbsp;significance) for the intention to treat analysis, but was&nbsp;in the all-cases analysis. The pattern of results was&nbsp;similar before adjusting for the covariates.</p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">Given the marginal significance of the intervention on sustained cessation at 12 months, we conducted multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression to explore&nbsp;whether there was any evidence of a significant interaction between follow-up period and outcome. In a regression model including the same covariates as above, the&nbsp;main effect of the intervention was significant (<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font6"> =&nbsp;0.02), demonstrating sustained benefit of the referral&nbsp;model. The time effect was also significant, indicating&nbsp;the reduced percentages remaining quit over time. The&nbsp;interaction between condition and time (3 months,&nbsp;12 months) was not significant (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font6"> = 0.57), demonstrating that the effect size did not differ significantly.</span></p>

The requirements for showing mediation were successfully met: treatment condition was significantly correlated with&nbsp;cessation outcomes and the potential mediator and intensive assistance was significantly related to outcomes&nbsp;when the effect of condition on outcome was controlled. Sobel-Goodman tests of mediation<sup>20</sup> confirmed that after controlling for use of intensive&nbsp;assistance, the relationship between treatment condition and sustained abstinence at 12 months was no&nbsp;longer significant (P = 0.45), with 58% of the treatment condition effect mediated.</p>

<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;">This research found that a system of encouraging GPs to refer smokers to an evidence-based cessation service resulted in cessation rates two to three times that&nbsp;of encouraging GPs to provide in-practice management. The effect was due to the smokers getting extra&nbsp;help to quit from outside the practice, while getting&nbsp;the same amount of help from within it. The benefit&nbsp;seems to be due to a combination of the extra help increasing both the number and success of quit attempts.&nbsp;The beneficial effect on quitting in the referral condition was sustained over time. The findings add to the&nbsp;growing body of evidence that health professional referral of patients who smoke to evidence-based Quit&nbsp;services is effective and acceptable to smokers.<sup>21,22</sup></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;">Readers need to remember that this is a trial of two systems of help provision, not of the efficacy of either&nbsp;kind. The quit rates are lower in this study than among&nbsp;those where acceptance of the selected intervention is&nbsp;a prerequisite for randomization.

<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Because GPs were not compliant in keeping records on how many presenting smokers they did not recruit&nbsp;into the study, we are unable to be certain to what extent bias occurred. We acknowledge that because GPs&nbsp;carried out much of the participant recruitment, bias&nbsp;may have occurred in terms of their perceptions of&nbsp;their patients’ interest in quitting. The most likely effect is that GPs in the in-practice condition would be&nbsp;less likely than those in the referral condition to recruit smokers low in perceived interest, as the GPs&nbsp;would have had less expectation that they would be&nbsp;able to effectively intervene. If so, the in-practice&nbsp;group may have been a more motivated sample, resulting in reduced capacity to find an effect. We see&nbsp;no other potential bias.</p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Consistent with our expectations, levels of external help were higher in the referral condition than in the&nbsp;in-practice condition. The additional external help&nbsp;was mainly more cognitive-behavioural assistance, as&nbsp;rates of use of pharmacotherapies were similar. Higher levels of external help mediated most of the increased cessation. The effect of treatment on&nbsp;outcomes was mediated by the amount of help patients received beyond that provided by their GP. We&nbsp;thus conclude that more smokers quit in the referral&nbsp;than in the in-practice condition because they received&nbsp;more external help, while getting the same amount of&nbsp;practice-based help.</p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">Active referral of smokers to the quitline service appeared acceptable to both GPs and the majority of their patients. A higher than anticipated number of referrals to the quitline occurred, and almost three-quarters&nbsp;of those contacted by the quitline accepted an intensive service. It was anticipated that around one-half of&nbsp;all patients in the referral arm would be referred, and&nbsp;that half of these would accept callback counselling,&nbsp;in line with Victorian Quitline estimates.<sup>23</sup></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">A notable finding was that the option of referral did not result in GPs providing less effective smoking cessation counselling within the consultation. This finding&nbsp;is important as it demonstrates that, at least in this&nbsp;case, referral was not compromising the quality of assistance provided within the practice. The sample of&nbsp;GPs almost certainly had a more than average interest&nbsp;in the issue of smoking. It was difficult recruiting GPs&nbsp;for this research and some of this stemmed from a reluctance to commit to extensive in-practice manage-ment.<sup>12</sup> It is likely that GPs who did not participate in&nbsp;our research were overall less interested in providing&nbsp;smoking cessation assistance than those recruited.&nbsp;Therefore, the levels of in-practice management&nbsp;achieved are likely to be overestimates of what is actually occurring. Referral provides a concrete outcome&nbsp;to a brief motivational intervention directed at encouraging quitting. Referral to effective help should&nbsp;be the preferred option for general practice, except&nbsp;perhaps where practices are prepared to invest in&nbsp;systematic cessation services. In this regard, it is also&nbsp;likely that rates of referral we obtained are unlikely&nbsp;to be replicated in routine practice.</p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">The callback counselling service was chosen by a far greater proportion of referred patients than the QuitCoach. It was expected that as patients referred by&nbsp;their GP may have been less motivated to quit than&nbsp;typical users of quitline services (i.e. those who proactively contact the service), they may have preferred&nbsp;the anonymity and lower intensity of the QuitCoach.&nbsp;However, in the context of an active referral by a GP,&nbsp;a personal service appears to be more acceptable than&nbsp;an automated, internet-based service. Perhaps having&nbsp;accepted an initial call from the quitline and becoming&nbsp;comfortable with the idea of talking to a counsellor&nbsp;about smoking cessation, any fears about the callback&nbsp;service were allayed. GP referral may thus be an effective means of reducing smoker reluctance to use the&nbsp;quitline, reasons for which include a lack of understanding about what the service offers.<sup>24</sup></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;">It is also notable that the absolute size of the difference in cessation rates for the point prevalence estimates was greater than for the corresponding sustained cessation effects, suggesting that those in&nbsp;the referral condition were continuing to make quit attempts throughout the follow-up period. This is evidence that referral (and the accompanying assistance)&nbsp;did not achieve its effect by bringing quit attempts forward that would otherwise have happened, but has&nbsp;had a sustained effect on cessation.</p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;">In conclusion, this research shows that an active referral strategy results in smokers getting more assistance to quit, and as such supports the view that referral to an evidence-based cessation service should&nbsp;become the normative strategy for management of&nbsp;smoking cessation in general practice. It also shows&nbsp;that a telephone quitline service is an appropriate vehicle for referral. Health authorities need to develop&nbsp;programs to encourage GPs to refer to quitlines, and&nbsp;in cases where they are provided free or subsidized to&nbsp;smokers, ensure that sufficient resources are allocated&nbsp;to enable counselling for all those who want it.</p>
