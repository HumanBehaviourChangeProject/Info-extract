This report provides outcomes at 2 to 6 years postbaseline; the primary outcome is a four-category smoking status variable (quit at all follow-ups, quit at final follow-up only, smoker at all follow-ups, and smoker at final follow-up only); quit attempts among those who reported smoking at the final follow-up is a secondary outcome. METHODS: PFH was a randomized control trial with two conditions, peer phone counseling (PC) and self-help (SH), that involved smokers (n = 796) enrolled in the CCSS cohort. RESULTS: Long-term quit rates were higher in PC versus SH participants. Long-term smoking cessation outcomes were lower among those who were nicotine dependent, of lower educational levels, and among men, and were higher among those who used nicotine replacement therapy and who had higher levels of situational self-efficacy. There were no significant differences in relapse rates between conditions or in quit attempts among continued smokers. CONCLUSION: Cessation rates continue to be significantly higher among participants in the PC condition versus SH, although the differences were not large. This article highlights differences in long-term engagement with smoking cessation among those who received the intervention.","Comments":"30880[PII] 19047296[pmid] J Clin Oncol","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Emmons Karen M;

Overall 56 patients (15.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.7-19.1%) had claimed to have stopped smoking at 2 months and 29 patients (8.0%, 95% CI 5.9-10.1%) were confirmed to have stopped smoking at 6 months. There was no significant difference between the groups at either 2 or 6 months (risk ratios 1.06 and 1.09, respectively, P = 0.78). A preoperative:postoperative ratio of a visual analogue scale measuring the patient's motivation to stop smoking was not significantly different (control group 1.13 vs message group 1.10, P = 0.55).

DESIGN: Participants who completed pretreatment assessment were randomly assigned to treatment conditions. Smoking status was evaluated at posttreatment, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up intervals. SETTING: The study was based in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods in Queens, New York. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-three Hispanic smokers participated: 48 men and 45 women. INTERVENTION: The multicomponent treatment involved a clinic-based group program that incorporated a culturally specific component consisting of videotaped presentations of culturally laden smoking-related vignettes. The self-help control program was enhanced by the use of an introductory group session and follow-up supportive telephone calls. MEASURES: Smoking outcomes were based on cotinine-validated abstinence and self-reported smoking rates. Predictors of abstinence were examined, including sociodemographic variables, smoking history, nicotine dependence, acculturation, partner interactions, reasons for quitting, self-efficacy, and linguistic competence. RESULTS: Significant group differences in cotinine-validated abstinence rates in favor of the multicomponent group were obtained, but only at posttreatment. With missing data included and coded for nonabstinence, validated abstinence rates at posttreatment were 21% for the multicomponent group and 6% for the self-help group. At the 6-month follow-up, the rates were 13% for the multicomponent group and 9% for the self-help group. By the 12-month follow-up, the rates declined to 8% and 7% for the multicomponent and self-help groups, respectively. A dose-response relationship between attendance at group sessions and abstinence status was shown at posttreatment and 6-month follow-up intervals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 332 male smokers aged between 30-65 years old, registered for a smoking cessation program in a public health center in a city, were recruited and underwent a baseline survey from January 2010 to February 2011. They were then prospectively randomized to a conventional counseling group (n=165) or a KHRA group (n=167), and received conventional counseling or KHRA-based counseling for six months. Abstinence rates were identified through carbon monoxide measurement (at the 4th and 24th weeks) or urinary cotinine level (at the 12th week). RESULTS: The abstinence rate confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide was significantly higher in the KHRA group (61.1%) than the control group (49.1%) at the 4th week (absolute difference 12.0%, 95% CI: 1.4%-22.6%). However, there was no difference in abstinence rates between the two groups at the 12th and 24th weeks. The predicting factors of 24 week's smoking cessation success were age, older than 50 years old (OR 2.02, 95% CI: 1.16-3.52), lower Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence score less than 4 (OR 1.84, 95% CI: 1.03-3.29), and higher Self Efficacy\/Temptation score (OR 1.79, 95% CI: 1.05-3.06). CONCLUSIONS: Smoking cessation counseling with KHRA could be effective compared to conventional counseling in the short period of smoking cessation. Further study is needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of KHRA in tobacco dependence treatment and to establish the indication and target population of this tool.","Comments":"LR: 20170308; JID: 101130625; 7U1EE4V452 (Carbon Monoxide); K5161X06LL (Cotinine); ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Paek Y J; Lee S ; Kim Y H; Lee K S; Yim H W; Kim M S; Kim C H; Jeung O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nCarbon Monoxide\/analysis\r\nCotinine\/urine\r\nCounseling\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHealth Status Indicators\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMotivation\r\nPrognosis\r\nProspective Studies\r\nSmoking\/prevention & control\/psychology\r\nSmoking Cessation\/psychology\/statistics & numerical data\r\nTobacco Use Disorder\/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507430,"AdditionalText":"Male smokers aged 30-65 years\rold, who had registered in the smoking cessation program\rof Public Health Center in Anyang City from January 2010 to February 2011 were recruited in this study.

DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: five general practices in Hertfordshire, England. PARTICIPANTS: 561 current smokers aged over 35. INTERVENTION: All participants were offered spirometric assessment of lung function. Participants in intervention group received their results in terms of \"lung age\" (the age of the average healthy individual who would perform similar to them on spirometry). Those in the control group received a raw figure for forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1). Both groups were advised to quit and offered referral to local NHS smoking cessation services. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was verified cessation of smoking by salivary cotinine testing 12 months after recruitment. Secondary outcomes were reported changes in daily consumption of cigarettes and identification of new diagnoses of chronic obstructive lung disease. RESULTS: Follow-up was 89%. Independently verified quit rates at 12 months in the intervention and control groups, respectively, were 13.6% and 6.4% (difference 7.2%, P=0.005, 95% confidence interval 2.2% to 12.1%; number needed to treat 14). People with worse spirometric lung age were no more likely to have quit than those with normal lung age in either group. Cost per successful quitter was estimated at 280 pounds sterling (366 euros, $556). A new diagnosis of obstructive lung disease was made in 17% in the intervention group and 14% in the control group; a total of 16% (89\/561) of participants. CONCLUSION: Telling smokers their lung age significantly improves the likelihood of them quitting smoking, but the mechanism by which this intervention achieves its effect is unclear.

The present study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a telephone-based intervention for nonsmoking support persons. METHODS: A total of 59 support persons (mean age = 36 years, 92% female, 95% White) were randomly assigned to a control condition (N = 30; written materials only) or to a social cognitive theory-based intervention (N = 29; written materials and 5 weekly, 20- to 30-min telephone counseling sessions). Both support persons and smokers completed assessments separately by mail at baseline and at weeks 6 (end of treatment) and 26. RESULTS: Two thirds of the smokers reported low-moderate levels of motivation to quit at baseline as assessed by the contemplation ladder. Study retention rates were excellent, with 95% of both support persons and smokers completing the week 26 assessment. Moreover, 86% of support persons in the intervention group completed all five telephone sessions. Treatment acceptability was high for both support persons and smokers. Compared with the control condition, the intervention was associated with a significant increase in support person self-efficacy to help their smoker (p = .034) and outcome expectancies (p = .025) from baseline to week 6. However, the intervention was not associated with higher smoking abstinence rates or quit attempts. DISCUSSION: The program was successful in reaching smokers with lower levels of readiness to quit. The intervention was feasible and acceptable to both support persons and smokers. Although support persons and smokers can be engaged in this type of outreach program, refinements in the intervention approach are needed to improve the smoking outcomes.","Comments":"LR: 20161019;

METHODS: Participants were 303 adult daily smokers randomized to CDT or ST, plus pharmacotherapy. Abstinence though 1 year was examined using logistic random intercept models, a type of generalized linear mixed model regression. RESULTS: Results did not support the efficacy of the CDT program through 1 year postquit in analyses adjusted for time and study site (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.55-1.30), or after further adjusting for race\/ethnicity, age, gender, education, marital status, and the number of cigarettes smoked per day before quitting (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.57-1.39). CONCLUSIONS: CDT did not increase short- or long-term abstinence rates over ST in this study. IMPACT: findings differ from some in the literature and suggest the need for continued research on the use of CDT for smoking cessation.","Comments":"LR: 20161122; CI: (c)2011; GR: P30 CA016672\/CA\/NCI NIH HHS\/United States;

Brief smoking counseling during prenatal care is effective but generates modest cessation rates. Telephone counseling is an effective smoking cessation method that could offer pregnant women convenient access to more intensive smoking cessation counseling. METHODS: The efficacy of proactive pregnancy-tailored telephone counseling for smoking cessation was compared with a \"best-practice\" brief-counseling control in a randomized controlled trial of 442 pregnant smokers referred by prenatal providers and a managed care plan. Trained counselors using cognitive-behavioral and motivational interviewing methods called intervention subjects throughout pregnancy and for 2 months postpartum (mean = 5 calls, mean total contact = 68 minutes). Controls received one 5-minute counseling call. RESULTS: Cotinine-validated 7-day tobacco abstinence rates in intervention and control groups were 10.0% and 7.5% at end of pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-2.70; number needed to treat = 40) and 6.7% versus 7.1% at 3 months postpartum (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.44-1.99). The intervention increased end-of-pregnancy cessation rates among 201 light smokers (< 10 cigarettes\/day at study enrollment) (intervention 19.1% versus control 8.4%; OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.1-6.1; number needed to treat = 9.3) and among 193 smokers who attempted to quit in pregnancy before enrollment (intervention 18.1% versus control 6.8%; OR 3.02, CI 1.15-7.94; number needed to treat = 8.8); 63% of the sample (n = 267) was in one of these subgroups. CONCLUSION: Proactive pregnancy-tailored telephone counseling did not outperform a brief \"best practice\" intervention among pregnant smokers. The intervention had efficacy in light smokers and in women who had attempted cessation earlier in pregnancy. Future studies should confirm whether telephone counseling benefits these groups of pregnant smokers. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, #NCT00181909.

Aerobic exercise reduces anxiety sensitivity and aspects of the risk conferred by anxiety sensitivity. In the current study, we examined whether exercise can aid smoking cessation in adults with high anxiety sensitivity. METHODS: Participants were sedentary and low-activity adult daily smokers (n = 136) with elevated prescreen anxiety sensitivity. Participants received 15 weeks of standard smoking cessation treatment (ST; cognitive behavioral therapy plus nicotine replacement therapy). In addition, participants were simultaneously randomized to 15 weeks of either an exercise intervention (ST + EX; n = 72) or a wellness education control condition (ST + CTRL; n = 64). Self-reported smoking abstinence was assessed weekly during the intervention, at the end of treatment (10 weeks after the target quit date), and at 4 and 6 months after the target quit date. Abstinence was verified by expired carbon monoxide readings and saliva cotinine. RESULTS: Results indicated that point prevalence abstinence (PPA) and prolonged abstinence (PA) rates were significantly higher for ST + EX than for ST + CTRL at each of the major end points among persons with high anxiety sensitivity (PPA: b = -0.91, standard error [SE] = 0.393, t(1171) = -2.33, p = .020; PA: b = -0.98, SE = 0.346, t(132) = -2.84, p = .005), but not among those with low anxiety sensitivity (PPA: b = -0.23, SE = 0.218, t(1171) = -1.06, p = .29; PA: b = -0.31, SE = 0.306, t(132) = -1.01, p = .32). CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that exercise facilitates the odds of quit success for smokers with high levels of anxiety sensitivity and therefore may be a useful therapeutic tactic for this high-risk segment of the smoking population.

The aim of this study was to determine if a smoking cessation intervention initiated during a psychiatric hospitalization and continued postdischarge was effective in reducing smoking behaviors among persons with a mental disorder. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at an Australian inpatient psychiatric facility. Participants were 205 patient smokers allocated to a treatment as usual control (n = 101) or a smoking cessation intervention (n = 104) incorporating psychosocial and pharmacological support for 4 months postdischarge. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 1 week, 2, 4, and 6 months postdischarge and included abstinence from cigarettes, quit attempts, daily cigarette consumption, and nicotine dependence. RESULTS: Rates of continuous and 7-day point prevalence abstinence did not differ between treatment conditions at the 6-month follow-up; however, point prevalence abstinence was significantly higher for intervention (11.5%) compared with control (2%) participants at 4 months (OR = 6.46, p = .01). Participants in the intervention condition reported significantly more quit attempts (F[1, 202.5] = 15.23, p = .0001), lower daily cigarette consumption (F[4, 586] = 6.5, p < .001), and lower levels of nicotine dependence (F[3, 406] = 8.5, p < .0001) compared with controls at all follow-up assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Postdischarge cessation support was effective in encouraging quit attempts and reducing cigarette consumption up to 6 months postdischarge. Additional support strategies are required to facilitate longer-term cessation benefits for smokers with a mental disorder.","Comments":"LR: 20141010; CI: (c) The Author 2014; JID: 9815751;

The intervention included a meeting with the nurse-case manager; the use of a videotape, workbook, relaxation audiotape, and nicotine replacement therapy; and nurse-initiated phone contacts after discharge.

DESIGN: Cluster randomised trial, 2x2 factorial design. SETTING: 82 medical practices in Germany, including 94 general practitioners. PARTICIPANTS: 577 patients who smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day (irrespective of their intention to stop smoking) and were aged 36-75 years. INTERVENTIONS: Provision of a 2-h physician group training in smoking cessation methods and direct physician payments for every participant not smoking 12 months after recruitment (TI, training+incentive); provision of the same training and direct participant reimbursements for pharmacy costs associated with nicotine replacement therapy or bupropion treatment (TM, training+medication). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-reported smoking abstinence obtained at 12 months follow-up and validated by serum cotinine. RESULTS: In intention-to-treat analysis, smoking abstinence at 12 months follow-up was 3% (2\/74), 3% (5\/144), 12% (17\/140) and 15% (32\/219) in the usual care, and interventions TI, TM and TI+TM, respectively. Applying a mixed logistic regression model, no effect was identified for intervention TI (odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 2.43), but intervention TM strongly increased the odds of cessation (OR 4.77, 95% CI 2.03 to 11.22). CONCLUSION: Providing cost-free effective drugs to patients along with improved training opportunities for general practitioners could be an effective measure to achieve successful promotion of smoking cessation in general practice.","Comments":"LR: 20140907; JID: 9209612; K5161X06LL (Cotinine); OID: NLM: PMC2598437; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Twardella D ; Brenner H

METHODS: A randomized controlled experimental design included intervention participants (n = 147) enrolled in a nurse-managed, lay-led protocol that incorporated nicotine replacement and behavioral counseling. Control participants (n = 155) received a personalized letter from their clinic physician, who advised them to quit smoking and requested they schedule a clinic appointment to discuss cessation. RESULTS: Self-reported and cotinine-validated quit rates were significantly higher among intervention group participants compared with control group participants at 3-and 6-month follow-up (P or = 16 (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: A lay-led approach that is managed by a nurse may serve as an effective cessation strategy among this high-risk population. Additional efforts are needed to sustain long-term abstinence, even after intensive intervention.","Comments":"LR: 20161122; GR: M01 RR000034\/RR\/NCRR NIH HHS\/United States; GR: P50 CA105632\/CA\/NCI NIH HHS\/United States;

Evidence exists that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) approximately doubles smoking cessation rates. The minimal intervention strategy (MIS) has been used successfully to assist patients to quit smoking in general practice, and was recently adapted for cardiology inpatients (C-MIS). It is hypothesized that in cardiovascular outpatients the combination of C-MIS and NRT significantly increases the number of quitters compared to NRT alone. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial in 385 smoking patients who attended the cardiovascular outpatient departments in the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam for the treatment of atherosclerotic disease. Patients were allocated to either NRT + C-MIS or NRT alone. Self-reported and biochemically validated abstinence rates were measured at 12 months' follow-up. RESULTS: Including patients with incomplete follow-up as smokers, abstinence was reported by 19% of the NRT + C-MIS group and 14% of the NRT group [absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 0.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.02; 0.12]. According to biochemical markers, abstinence rates were 28 and 24%, respectively (ARR = 0.04, 95% CI = -0.06; 0.14). Hence, no significant differences between groups were found. The number of cigarettes smoked a day decreased significantly at 12 months: from 21 to 15 a day in the experimental group, and from 21 to 14 in the control group (P<0.001), but did not differ between groups (P=0.32). CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of a minimal contact intervention was investigated in order to reach as many cardiovascular patients as possible in the setting of outpatient departments. This intervention was not found to be effective.","Comments":"LR: 20151119; JID: 101192000; 6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine); ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wiggers L C; Smets E M; Oort F J; Peters R J; Storm-Versloot M N; Vermeulen H ; de Haes  ; H C ; Legemate D A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097\/hjr.0b013e328010f263 [doi]","Keywords":"Administration, Cutaneous\r\nCardiovascular Diseases\/nursing\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLogistic Models\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNicotine\/administration & dosage\r\nSmoking Cessation\/methods\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507424,"AdditionalText":"Exclusion criteria were\rhaving an acute myocardial infarction in the previous\rmonth, unstable angina, serious arrhythmia, recent\rstroke, skin allergy, pregnancy and insufficient compre-\rhension of the Dutch language.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263278,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"Dutch[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Wiggers 2006a primary paper.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint3"},{"AttributeId":4507490,"AdditionalText":"Consecutive patients were recruited at the outpatient\rdepartments of vascular surgery, cardiology and vascular\rmedicine of the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

METHOD: A randomized, 10-week trial with follow-up at 3 and 6 months after smoking quit date conducted at 12 substance use disorder treatment programs between February 2010 and July 2012. Adults meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for cocaine and\/or methamphetamine dependence and interested in quitting smoking were randomized to treatment as usual (n = 271) or treatment as usual with smoking-cessation treatment (n = 267). All participants received treatment as usual for substance use disorder treatment. Participants assigned to treatment as usual with concurrent smoking-cessation treatment received weekly individual smoking cessation counseling and extended-release bupropion (300 mg\/d) during weeks 1-10. During post-quit treatment (weeks 4-10), participants assigned to treatment as usual with smoking-cessation treatment received a nicotine inhaler and contingency management for smoking abstinence. Weekly proportion of stimulant-abstinent participants during the treatment phase, as assessed by urine drug screens and self-report, was the primary outcome. Secondary measures included other substance\/nicotine use outcomes and treatment attendance. RESULTS: There were no significant treatment effects on stimulant-use outcomes, as measured by the primary outcome and stimulant-free days, on drug-abstinence, or on attendance. Participants assigned to treatment as usual with smoking-cessation treatment, relative to those assigned to treatment as usual, had significantly better outcomes for drug-free days at 6-month follow-up (chi(2)(1) = 4.09, P <.05), with a decrease in drug-free days from baseline of -1.3% in treatment as usual with smoking-cessation treatment and of -7.6% in treatment as usual. Participants receiving treatment as usual with smoking-cessation treatment, relative to those receiving treatment as usual, had significantly better outcomes on smoking point-prevalence abstinence (25.5% vs 2.2%; chi(2)(1) = 44.69, P < .001; OR =18.2). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that providing smoking-cessation treatment to illicit stimulant-dependent patients in outpatient substance use disorder treatment will not worsen, and may enhance, abstinence from nonnicotine substance use.

METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial of 20 pediatric practices in 16 states that received either Clinical and Community Effort Against Secondhand Smoke Exposure (CEASE) intervention or usual care. The intervention provided practices with training to provide evidence-based assistance to parents who smoke. The primary outcome, assessed by the 12-month follow-up telephone survey with parents, was provision of meaningful tobacco control assistance, defined as discussing various strategies to quit smoking, discussing smoking cessation medication, or recommending the use of the state quitline after initial enrollment visit. We also assessed parental quit rates at 12 months, determined by self-report and biochemical verification. RESULTS: Practices' rates of providing any meaningful tobacco control assistance (55% vs 19%), discussing various strategies to quit smoking (25% vs 10%), discussing cessation medication (41% vs 11%), and recommending the use of the quitline (37% vs 9%) were all significantly higher in the intervention than in the control groups, respectively (P < .0001 for each), during the 12-month postintervention implementation. Receiving any assistance was associated with a cotinine-confirmed quitting adjusted odds ratio of 1.89 (95% confidence interval: 1.13-3.19). After controlling for demographic and behavioral factors, the adjusted odds ratio for cotinine-confirmed quitting in intervention versus control practices was 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 0.64-1.78). CONCLUSIONS: Intervention practices had higher rates of delivering tobacco control assistance than usual care practices over the 1-year follow-up period. Parents who received any assistance were more likely to quit smoking; however, parents' likelihood of quitting smoking was not statistically different between the intervention and control groups. Maximizing parental quit rates will require more complete systems-level integration and adjunctive cessation strategies.","Comments":"LR: 20161019; CI: Copyright (c) 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov\/NCT00664261; GR: R01 CA127127\/CA\/NCI NIH HHS\/United States; GR: R01-CA127127\/CA\/NCI NIH HHS\/United States; GR: UA6MC15585\/PHS HHS\/United States; JID: 0376422; CIN: Pediatrics. 2014 Nov;134(5):1028-9.

METHODS: Of 2348 smokers, 350 were randomly allocated into study and control groups (n = 175 each). An individualized therapy cessation technique was selected for each participant (combination of behavioral counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and\/or pharmacotherapy). The participants in the control group attended a standard quit program, whereas the study group also received an additional 5-session (90 minutes each) cognitive behavioral therapy-oriented program aimed at improving their anger and stress coping skills. At the beginning of the study, both groups were asked to complete the Trait Anger Scale (TAS) of the State and Trait Anger Scale and the Self-Confident (SCS) and Hopeless (HS) subscales of the Stress Coping Styles Inventory; pretest smoking status of both groups and their coping skills were compared with each other as soon as the program ended (post-test results) and after 3 and 6 months (first and second follow-up tests). RESULTS: Although there was no difference between pretest scores on the TAS (P = .234), SCS (P = .130), and HS (P = .148) subscales, post-test results indicate that the study groups' TAS and HS scores decreased and SCS scores increased (P .05). The study group had a better quit level after 6 months compared with the control group (44% vs 27.4%; P < .001). The anger management and stress control program was found to have a significant effect on cessation (odds ratio, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-3.85). CONCLUSION: The anger and stress coping skills program may increase the success of quitting smoking.","Comments":"LR: 20140909; CI: (c) Copyright 2014; JID: 101256526; OTO: NOTNLM; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yalcin B M; Unal M ; Pirdal H ; Karahan T F; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3122\/jabfm.2014.05.140083 [doi]","Keywords":"Adaptation, Psychological\r\nAdult\r\nAnger\r\nCognitive Therapy\/methods\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLogistic Models\r\nMale\r\nSmoking\/prevention & control\/psychology\/therapy\r\nSmoking Cessation\/methods\/statistics & numerical data\r\nStress, Psychological\/psychology\/therapy\r\nTobacco Use Cessation Products\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nTurkey\r\nCognitive Therapy\r\nPsychological Stress\r\nSmoking\r\nSmoking Cessation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507427,"AdditionalText":"Sex (n)\rMen 87 89 .102 0.686\rWomen 88 86\rAge (years) 35.25\r\r","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263289,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"(n) Men 87[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Yalcin 2014.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint3"},{"AttributeId":4507435,"AdditionalText":"Women 88 86\rAge (years) 35.25\r","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263289,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"35.25 \b 21.25[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Yalcin 2014.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint3"},{"AttributeId":4507447,"AdditionalText":"Divorced 5 (3) 6 (4)\rEducation year 9.25 \r","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263289,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\" 9.25 \b 1.8[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Yalcin 2014.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint3"},{"AttributeId":4507419,"AdditionalText":"Marital status .098 0.143\rSingle 11 (8) 10 (6)\rMarried 140 (86) 147 (88)","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263289,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"8[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Yalcin 2014.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint3"},{"AttributeId":4507428,"AdditionalText":"Single 11 (8) 10 (6)\rMarried 140 (86) 147 (88)\rWidow 6 (4) 3 (2)","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263289,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"86[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Yalcin 2014.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint3"},{"AttributeId":4507431,"AdditionalText":"Widow 6 (4) 3 (2)\rDivorced 5 (3) 6 (4)\rEducation year 9.25\r","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263289,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"3[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Yalcin 2014.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint3"},{"AttributeId":4507436,"AdditionalText":"Married 140 (86) 147 (88)\rWidow 6 (4) 3 (2)\rDivorced 5 (3) 6 (4)","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263289,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"4[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Yalcin 2014.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint3"},{"AttributeId":3675611,"AdditionalText":"All subjects took part in several types of smoking\rcessation activities according to their smoking status,\rdependency level, and indications.\r27\u201330\rThis program\rincludes a group workshop, face-to-face interventions\rdoi: 10.3122\/jabfm.2014.05.140083 Anger Management and Stress Control Program for Smoking Cessation 647\raimed at maintaining lifestyle changes, NRT, and\rpharmacotherapy.++","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263289,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"NRT, and pharmacotherapy.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Yalcin 2014.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint3"},{"AttributeId":3673306,"AdditionalText":" At this workshop, members share\rprevious smoking cessation experiences. ++","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263289,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\" share previous smoking cessation experiences.

An inability to tolerate distress is a significant predictor of early smoking lapse following a cessation attempt. We conducted a preliminary randomized controlled trial to compare a distress tolerance (DT) treatment that incorporated elements of exposure-based therapies and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to standard smoking cessation treatment (ST). METHODS: Smokers with a history of early lapse in prior quit attempts received either DT (N = 27; 9 2-hr group and 6 50-min individual sessions) or ST (N = 22; 6 90-min group and 1 20-min individual session), plus 8 weeks of transdermal nicotine patch. RESULTS: At the end of behavioral treatment, odds of abstinence among participants receiving DT were 6.46 times greater than among participants receiving ST (66.7% vs. 31.8%), equivalent to a medium- to large-effect size. Odds of abstinence for DT were still 1.73 times greater at 8 weeks, corresponding to a small- to medium-effect size, although neither this difference nor those at 13 and 26 weeks were statistically significant. Furthermore, of those who lapsed to smoking during the first week postquit, DT participants had more than 4 times greater odds of abstinence than ST participants at the end of treatment. Relative to ST, DT participants also reported a larger decrease in experiential avoidance, a hypothesized DT treatment mediator, prior to quit day. The trajectory of negative mood and withdrawal symptoms in DT differed from ST and was largely consistent with hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS: Reasons for the decrease in abstinence in DT after treatment discontinuation and suggestions for future research are discussed.","Comments":"LR: 20161019; GR: DA017332\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United States; JID: 9815751; 6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine); OID: NLM: PMC3819975; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Brown R A; Reed K M; Bloom E L; Minami H ; Strong D R; Lejuez C W; Kahler C W; Zvolensky M J; Gifford E V; Hayes S C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093\/ntr\/ntt093 [doi]","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAffect\r\nAged\r\nBehavior Therapy\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNicotine\/administration & dosage\r\nSmoking\/psychology\/therapy\r\nSmoking Cessation\/methods\/psychology\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome\/psychology\/therapy\r\nTime Factors\r\nTobacco Use Cessation Products\r\nTobacco Use Disorder\/psychology\/therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507435,"AdditionalText":" Participants mean age was 47.68 (SD = 10.31)\ryears, 49% were females, 32.7% had a high-school education\ror less, 4.1% were Hispanics\/Latinos, and 90% were\rCaucasians.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263074,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"47.68[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Brown-2013 primary.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507427,"AdditionalText":"Participants mean age was 47.68 (SD = 10.31)\ryears, 49% were females, 32.7% had a high-school education\ror less, 4.1% were Hispanics\/Latinos,","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263074,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\" 49% were females,[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Brown-2013 primary.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507448,"AdditionalText":"Education\r<High-school graduate 2 (7.4) 4 (18.2%)\rHigh-school graduate 4 (14.8) 6 (27.3%)\rSome college 14 (51.9) 9 (40.9 %)\rCollege degree 3 (11.1) 2 (9.1%)\r>Master\u2019s degree 4 (14.8) 1 (4.5%)\rMarital statusParticipants mean age was 47.68 (SD = 10.31)\ryears, 49% were females, 32.7% had a high-school education\ror less, 4.1% were Hispanics\/Latinos, and 90% were\rCaucasians.

However, little is known about the efficacy of smoking cessation intervention after stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). METHODS: Ninety-four smokers under age 76, admitted with ischemic stroke or TIA were randomized to minimal smoking cessation intervention or intensive smoking cessation intervention. All patients attended a 30-min individual counseling by the study nurse. Patients randomized to intensive smoking cessation intervention also participated in a 5-session outpatient smoking cessation program by an authorized smoking cessation instructor, a 30-min outpatient visit after 6 weeks, and 5 telephone counseling sessions by the study nurse. Free samples of nicotine replacement therapy were offered as part of the intensive smoking cessation program. Smoking cessation rates at 6 months were determined by self-report and verified by measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide (CO). Fewer patients than expected were recruited, which renders this report a pilot study. RESULTS: The 6-month self-reported smoking cessation rate was 37.8% in the minimal intervention group and 42.9% in the intensive intervention group. Smoking cessation rates verified by exhaled CO levels in the minimal intervention group and the intensive intervention group were 28.9% and 32.7%, respectively. No difference was found between the two groups (chi(2) = 0.16, p = .69). CONCLUSIONS: Overall smoking cessation rates were moderate and comparable to the results from other studies. Intensive smoking cessation intervention was not superior to short smoking cessation intervention. Thus, other factors than intensity of smoking cessation intervention might influence the smoking cessation rates after stroke or TIA.","Comments":"LR: 20120328; JID: 9815751; 7U1EE4V452 (Carbon Monoxide); ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Brunner Frandsen N; Sorensen M ; Hyldahl T K; Henriksen R M; Bak S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093\/ntr\/ntr233 [doi]","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nCarbon Monoxide\/metabolism\r\nCounseling\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nIschemic Attack, Transient\/prevention & control\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPilot Projects\r\nSelf Report\r\nSmoking\/therapy\r\nSmoking Cessation\/methods\r\nStroke\/prevention & control\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507411,"AdditionalText":"Age, years\r25\u201349 10 (22.2) 10 (20.4)\r50\u201365 21 (46.7) 29 (59.2)\r65 + 14 (31.1) 10 (20.4)\rFemale 22 (48.9) 17 (34.7)","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263292,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"25\u201349\"\n\"20.4\"\n\"50\u201365\"\n\"59.2\"\n\"65 +\"\n\"20.4[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Frandsen-2012.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507427,"AdditionalText":"65 + 14 (31.1) 10 (20.4)\rFemale 22 (48.9) 17 (34.7)\rSSSa on admission (mean) 51.6 54.4","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263292,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Female\"\n\"34.7[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Frandsen-2012.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507418,"AdditionalText":"Partner who smokes daily 20 (44.4) 13 (26.5)\rLiving alone 14 (31.1) 10 (20.4)\rNote.

A total of 286 current smokers were enrolled in a randomized controlled smoking cessation trial at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Participants in both treatment conditions were seen for two 60-min sessions, and received three follow-up phone calls and 2 months of NP. At 6 months, 29% of the hypnosis group reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence compared with 23% of the behavioral counseling group (relative risk [RR] = 1.27; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.84-1.92). Based on biochemical or proxy confirmation, 26% of the participants in the hypnosis group were abstinent at 6 months compared with 18% of the behavioral group (RR = 1.44; 95% CI 0.91-2.30). At 12 months, the self-reported 7-day point-prevalence quit rate was 24% for the hypnosis group and 16% for the behavioral group (RR = 1.47; 95% CI 0.90-2.40). Based on biochemical or proxy confirmation, 20% of the participants in the hypnosis group were abstinent at 12 months compared with 14% of the behavioral group (RR = 1.40; 95% CI 0.81-2.42). Among participants with a history of depression, hypnosis yielded significantly higher validated point-prevalence quit rates at 6 and 12 months than standard treatment. It was concluded that hypnosis combined with NP compares favorably with standard behavioral counseling in generating long-term quit rates.","Comments":"LR: 20151119; JID: 9815751; 0 (Ganglionic Stimulants);

This pilot study explored the use of resistance training (RT) (i.e., weight lifting) as an adjunctive strategy for quitting smoking for both men and women. METHODS: A sample of 25 smokers received a brief smoking cessation counseling session and the nicotine patch prior to being randomized into a 12-week RT or contact control (CC) group. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 3-month, and at a 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Participants (52% female) averaged 36.5 years (SD = 12.0) of age and 19.1 years (SD = 12.0) of smoking. At the 3-month assessment, objectively verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) rates were 46% for the RT group and 17% for CC; prolonged abstinence rates were 16% and 8%, respectively. At the 6-month assessment, objectively verified 7-day PPA rates were 38% for the RT group and 17% for CC; prolonged abstinence rates were 15% and 8%, respectively. Mean body weight decreased 0.6 kg (SD = 1.7) in the RT group and increased 0.6 kg (SD = 2.8) in the CC group. Mean body fat decreased 0.5% (SD = 1.8) in the RT group and increased 0.6% (SD = 0.7) in the CC. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting on the use of a RT program as an aid to smoking cessation treatment. The findings suggest that such a program is feasible as an adjunctive treatment for smoking cessation. An adequately powered trial is warranted.","Comments":"LR: 20161019; GR: R03 CA132475\/CA\/NCI NIH HHS\/United States; JID: 9815751; 6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine); OID: NLM: PMC3150692; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ciccolo J T; Dunsiger S I; Williams D M; Bartholomew J B; Jennings E G; Ussher M H; Kraemer W J; Marcus B H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093\/ntr\/ntr068 [doi]","Keywords":"Adipose Tissue\r\nAdolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nExercise\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNicotine\r\nPilot Projects\r\nResistance Training\/methods\r\nSmoking\/prevention & control\/psychology\r\nSmoking Cessation\/methods\/psychology\r\nWeight Lifting\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507427,"AdditionalText":"After the 2-week run-in period, 26 were randomized into RT or CC.

Of the 15 studies identified in the literature assessing the effectiveness of tobacco cessation interventions delivered by pharmacists, this is the first randomized controlled trial conducted in the US of a pharmacist-delivered program for smoking cessation using biochemical confirmation. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness on smoking cessation of a face-to-face group program conducted by the pharmacist team compared with a brief standard care session delivered by a pharmacist over the telephone. METHODS: An open-label, prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted at a Veterans Health Administration, community-based outpatient clinic in the Rocky Mountain region. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a 3-session face-to-face group program conducted by the pharmacist team or one 5- to 10-minute standard care session delivered by the pharmacist team over the telephone. Participants in both groups were offered either immediate-release bupropion or nicotine patch at no cost. The primary outcome of self-reported abstinence was biochemically confirmed by urinary cotinine at 6 months after the quit date. RESULTS: One hundred one smokers were randomized from October 3, 2005, to March 30, 2007, with the last 6-month follow-up survey completed on November 6, 2007. Analysis of data was completed in December 2007. Using intent-to-treat procedures, confirmed abstinence rates at the end of 6 months were 28% in the pharmacist-delivered face-to-face treatment group and 11.8% in the standard care telephone session control group (p < 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that pharmacists are effective providers of tobacco cessation interventions. Greater utilization of pharmacists in tobacco cessation efforts could have a significant impact on smoking rates, prevention of tobacco-related diseases, and overall improvement in public health across the US.","Comments":"LR: 20151119; JID: 9203131; 01ZG3TPX31 (Bupropion); 6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine); K5161X06LL (Cotinine); ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dent L A; Harris K J;

People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\/AIDS (PLWHA) have a substantially higher prevalence of cigarette smoking compared to the general population. In addition, PLWHA are particularly susceptible to the adverse health effects of smoking. Our primary objective was to design and test the efficacy over 12 months of a smoking cessation intervention targeting PLWHA. METHODS: Participants were enrolled from an urban HIV clinic with a multiethnic and economically disadvantaged patient population. Participants received smoking cessation treatment either through usual care (UC) or counseling delivered by a cell phone intervention (CPI). The 7-day point prevalence abstinence was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months using logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS: We randomized 474 HIV-positive smokers to either the UC or CPI group. When evaluating the overall treatment effect (7-day abstinence outcomes from 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups), participants in the CPI group were 2.41 times (P = .049) more likely to demonstrate abstinence compared to the UC group. The treatment effect was strongest at the 3-month follow-up (odds ratio = 4.3, P .05). CONCLUSIONS: Cell phone-delivered smoking cessation treatment has a positive impact on abstinence rates compared to a usual care approach. Future research should focus on strategies for sustaining the treatment effect in the long term.","Comments":"LR: 20161019; GR: P30 CA016672\/CA\/NCI NIH HHS\/United States; GR: R01 CA097893\/CA\/NCI NIH HHS\/United States;

METHODS: We conducted a randomized clinical trial that included assessments at baseline and at months 3, 6, 12, and 18. Three hundred twenty-two patients in mental health outpatient treatment who were diagnosed with depression and smoked > or =1 cigarette per day participated. The desire to quit smoking was not a prerequisite for participation. Staged care intervention participants received computerized motivational feedback at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months and were offered a 6-session psychological counseling and pharmacological cessation treatment program. Brief contact control participants received a self-help guide and referral list of local smoking-treatment providers. RESULTS: As we hypothesized, abstinence rates among staged care intervention participants exceeded those of brief contact control participants at months 12 and 18. Significant differences favoring staged care intervention also were found in occurrence of a quit attempt and stringency of abstinence goal. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that individuals in psychiatric treatment for depression can be aided in quitting smoking through use of staged care interventions and that smoking cessation interventions used in the general population can be implemented in psychiatric outpatient settings.","Comments":"LR: 20161019; GR: T32 DA07250\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United States; GR: P50 DA009253\/DA\/NIDA NIH

The intervention previously demonstrated efficacy in insured psychiatric and nonpsychiatric samples with 20.0%-25.0% abstinence at 18 months. METHODS: Daily smokers, recruited in 2009-2010 from psychiatric units at an urban public hospital, were randomized to usual care (on-unit nicotine replacement plus quit advice) or intervention, which added a Transtheoretical-model tailored, computer-assisted intervention, stage-matched manual, brief counseling, and 10-week post-hospitalization nicotine replacement. RESULTS: The sample (N = 100, 69% recruitment rate, age M = 40) was 56% racial\/ethnic minority, 65% male, 79% unemployed, and 48% unstably housed, diagnosed with unipolar (54%) and bipolar (14%) depression and psychotic disorders (46%); 77% reported past-month illicit drug use. Prior to hospitalization, participants averaged 19 (SD = 11) cigarettes\/day for 23 (SD = 13) years; 80% smoked within 30 minutes of awakening; 25% were preparing to quit. Encouraging and comparable to effects in the general population, 7-day point prevalence abstinence for intervention versus control was 12.5% versus 7.3% at 3 months, 17.5% versus 8.5% at 6 months, and 26.2% versus 16.7% at 12 months. Retention exceeded 80% over 12 months. The odds of abstinence increased over time, predicted by higher self-efficacy, greater perceived social status, and diagnosis of psychotic disorder compared to unipolar depression. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate uninsured smokers with serious mental illness can engage in tobacco treatment research with quit rates comparable to the general population. A larger investigation is warranted. Inclusion of diverse smokers with mental illness in clinical trials is supported and encouraged.","Comments":"LR: 20170220; CI: (c) The Author 2015; GR: K23 DA018691\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United States;

Of 100 study-eligible women who were still smoking upon entering prenatal care, 58 were recruited from university-based and community obstetric practices to participate in a smoking cessation study. Participants were assigned to either contingent or noncontingent voucher conditions. Vouchers were available during pregnancy and for 12 weeks postpartum. In the contingent condition, vouchers were earned for biochemically verified smoking abstinence. In the noncontingent condition, vouchers were earned independent of smoking status. Abstinence monitoring and associated voucher delivery was conducted daily during the initial 5 days of the cessation effort, gradually decreased to every other week antepartum, increased to once weekly during the initial 4 weeks postpartum, and then decreased again to every other week for the remaining 8 weeks of the postpartum intervention period. Contingent vouchers increased 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at the end-of-pregnancy (37% vs. 9%) and 12-week postpartum (33% vs. 0%) assessments. That effect was sustained through the 24-week postpartum assessment (27% vs. 0%), which was 12 weeks after discontinuation of the voucher program. Total mean voucher earnings across antepartum and postpartum were 397 US dollars (SD=414 US dollars) and 313 US dollars (SD=142 dollars) in the contingent and noncontingent conditions, respectively. The magnitude of these treatment effects exceed levels typically observed with pregnant and recently postpartum smokers, and the maintenance of effects through 24 weeks postpartum extends the duration beyond those reported previously.","Comments":"LR: 20151119; GR: R01DA14028\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United States; JID: 9815751; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Higgins S T; Heil S H;

DESIGN: Parallel group, cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Families with Crohn's disease in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 497 smokers (mean age 42.6 (SD 14.4) years) who were first degree relatives of probands with Crohn's disease, with outcomes assessed on 209\/251 (based on DNA analysis) and 217\/246 (standard risk assessment). INTERVENTION: Communication of risk assessment for Crohn's disease by postal booklet based on family history of the disease and smoking status alone, or with additional DNA analysis for the NOD2 genotype. Participants were then telephoned by a National Health Service Stop Smoking counsellor to review the booklet and deliver brief standard smoking cessation intervention. Calls were tape recorded and a random subsample selected to assess fidelity to the clinical protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was smoking cessation for 24 hours or longer, assessed at six months. RESULTS: The proportion of participants stopping smoking for 24 hours or longer did not differ between arms: 35% (73\/209) in the DNA arm versus 36% (78\/217) in the non-DNA arm (difference -1%, 95% confidence interval -10% to 8%, P=0.83). The proportion making a quit attempt within the DNA arm did not differ between those who were told they had mutations putting them at increased risk (36%), those told they had none (35%), and those in the non-DNA arm (36%). CONCLUSION: Among relatives of patients with Crohn's disease, feedback of DNA based risk assessments does not motivate behaviour change to reduce risk any more or less than standard risk assessment. These findings accord with those across a range of populations and behaviours. They do not support the promulgation of commercial DNA based tests nor the search for gene variants that confer increased risk of common complex diseases on the basis that they effectively motivate health related behaviour change.

In such a trial we evaluated the effects of postal smoking cessation advice in smokers with asbestos exposure and\/or reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). All men aged 30-45 yrs (n=22,392) living in 34 municipalities in western Norway were invited to a cross-sectional community survey. Information on smoking habits and occupational asbestos exposure were obtained from self-administered questionnaires and measurements of FEV1 were performed with dry-wedge bellow spirometers. Among 16,393 participants we identified a group of 2,610 smokers with previous occupational asbestos exposure and\/or adjusted FEV1 in the lowest quartile. A random half (n=1,300) received a mailed personal letter from a respiratory physician with a person-specific health advice to quit smoking and a pamphlet on smoking cessation. The remaining smokers (n=1,310) acted as controls and did not receive any information. Twelve months after the intervention, information on smoking habits was re-examined using a postal questionnaire. Among the respondents (n=2,282), smoking cessation was reported altogether by 13.7% in the intervention group versus 9.9% in the control group (p<0.01). The 1 yr sustained quit rate (no smoking at all during the last year) was 5.6 versus 35% (p<0.05), respectively. Measurements of carbon monoxide in expired air (with < or = 10 parts per million) confirmed self-reported nonsmoking in samples of the two groups. In a community this simple postal smoking cessation advice from a respiratory physician based on person-specific risk factors improved the 1 yr sustained success rate by 60% in identified high-risk smokers.","Comments":"LR: 20151119;

This study compared the efficacy of 3 smoking cessation interventions provided in HIV clinical treatment settings. METHODS: Following a baseline assessment, 209 HIV-positive smokers were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions in a parallel group design. Treatment conditions were individual counseling plus nicotine replacement treatment (NRT), a computer-based Internet smoking treatment plus NRT, and self-help plus NRT. Smoking status was determined at follow-up assessments completed at 12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks following treatment initiation. RESULTS: Cessation rates ranged from 15% to 29%; however, no statistically significant differences in abstinence were found among the treatment conditions over time. Those employed, those who reported a greater desire to quit, or those with lower mood disturbance scores were more likely to achieve abstinence (p < .01). The number of cigarettes participants reported smoking in the 24hr prior to each assessment significantly declined over time (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Although we found no differences in abstinence rates across groups, the results indicate that integration of smoking cessation interventions is feasible in HIV clinical treatment settings, and cessation results are promising. The overall abstinence rates we report are comparable to those found in similar treatment studies across multiple populations. Further research is warranted.","Comments":"LR: 20170220; GR: R01-DA15791\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United States; GR: R01-DA02538\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United States; GR: R01 DA002538\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United

Results at the 2 year assessment are examined using a random-effects regression model. In addition, various definitions of quit-rate commonly used in smoking cessation research are explored and the advantages of using a public health approach in the worksite are examined.","Comments":"LR: 20071115; GR: 5R01 HL42987-02\/HL\/NHLBI NIH HHS\/United States; JID: 8608459; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jason L A; Salina D ; McMahon S D; Hedeker D ; Stockton M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Humans\r\nLogistic Models\r\nManuals as Topic\r\nMotivation\r\nProgram Evaluation\r\nRegression Analysis\r\nSampling Studies\r\nSelf-Help Groups\r\nSmoking Cessation\r\nWorkplace","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507427,"AdditionalText":"Gender (%)\rFemale 71.8 58 1 59.2\rMale 28.2 41 9 40.; Female 71.8 58 1 59.2\rMale 28.2 41 9 40.8\rRace","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263154,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"Fema\"\n\"59\"\n\"Mal\"\n\"40[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Jason1995 (true primary paper).pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507413,"AdditionalText":"Race (%)\rBlack 16.6 16.5 28.5\rWhite 77 6 70.6 63.0\rOther 5.8 12.9 8.5\rEmployment (°","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263154,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"Bla\"\n\"28\"\n\"Whi\"\n\"63\"\n\"Oth\"\n\"8[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Jason1995 (true primary paper).pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507449,"AdditionalText":"Employment (°1o)\rUnskilled, Skilled 27.4 25.4 28.8\rClerical, Technician 43.8 52.1 56 7\rManager, Professional 28.8 22.5 14.4\rMean age (SD) 37.4 (10.6) 37.8 (9.8) 38.3 (11.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263154,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"Unskilled, Ski\"\n\"28\"\n\"Clerical, Techn\"\n\"56 7\"\n\"Manager, Profe\"\n\"14[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Jason1995 (true primary paper).pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507437,"AdditionalText":"Mean years education (SD) 13.8 (2.2) 14.1 (2.2) 13.5 (2.3)\rMean SES (SD) 42.9 (19.4) 44.5 (19.1) 41.4 (19.8; h team.

Aim was to determine whether a smoking cessation intervention of moderate intensity would increase the smoking cessation rate in hospitalized smokers. Design was randomized trial, conducted in a university-affiliated cardio-pulmonary tertiary care center. Participants were hospitalized smokers aged < or =70 years. Intervention was a smoking cessation intervention consisting of education and psychological support, with or without pharmacological therapy, associated with follow-up phone calls. Patients assigned to the control group received usual care. Measurement was point prevalence cessation rate at 1-year follow-up. A total of 468 patients were screened; 196 were randomized. Although the smoking cessation rates at 12-month follow-up were higher than expected, we found no significant difference between the study groups (intervention: 30.3%; control: 27.8%). Similar results were obtained in patients whose smoking status was validated by urinary cotinine assay. Length of stay and dependence to nicotine were the only significant predictors of smoking cessation. A smoking cessation intervention of moderate intensity delivered in a tertiary cardio-pulmonary center did not increase the smoking cessation rate at 1-year follow-up. The results of this trial should not divert those who deliver care to inpatients from delivering a brief smoking cessation intervention.","Comments":"LR: 20080716; JID: 9815751; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lacasse Y ; Lamontagne R ; Martin S ; Simard S ; Arsenault M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080\/14622200801979142 [doi]","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nBehavior Therapy\/methods\r\nFemale\r\nHospitalization\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMotivation\r\nPatient Education as Topic\/methods\r\nSmoking\/therapy\r\nSmoking Cessation\/methods\r\nSocial Support\r\nSocioeconomic Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507435,"AdditionalText":"Characteristics Intervention group (n599) Control group (n597) p value\rAge (years) 52 (9) 52 (10) 0.4\rGender, % male 64% 68% 0.3","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263161,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"52 (9)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Lacasse-2007.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507427,"AdditionalText":"Age (years) 52 (9) 52 (10) 0.4\rGender, % male 64% 68% 0.3\rEducation (years) 10 (3) 10 (3) 0.5","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263161,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\" male 64%[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Lacasse-2007.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507418,"AdditionalText":"Education (years) 10 (3) 10 (3) 0.5\rLiving alone 31% 36% 0.2\rAt work 59% 58% 1.0","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263161,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"31%[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Lacasse-2007.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507459,"AdditionalText":"Living alone 31% 36% 0.2\rAt work 59% 58% 1.0\rSmoking history","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263161,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"59%[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Lacasse-2007.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507489,"AdditionalText":"Within 6 weeks after\rhospital discharge, the patients randomized to\rthe intervention group were contacted by tele-\rphone up to four times (Zhu et al., 1996) by the\rsame therapist who delivered the inpatient smok-\ring cessation intervention to provide continued\rsupport and further advice regarding relapse\rprevention. ; Patients were recruited from January 1, 2004 to\rDecember 31, 2005.

Some studies have suggested that adding more intensive interventions to brief advice may increase its effectiveness, but it is unclear whether this is true in general practice. AIMS: To determine whether brief advice from a doctor together with counselling and follow-up from a trained practice nurse is more effective than brief advice alone in helping people to stop smoking. METHODS: The design was a randomized controlled trial. Four hundred and ninety-seven general practice patients aged older than 18 years and smoking at least one cigarette per day in six general practices in Oxfordshire, Berkshire, and Buckinghamshire were randomized to one of two interventions: brief verbal or written advice from a GP plus extended counselling and follow-up from a trained practice nurse; brief advice from a GP alone. The primary outcome was sustained abstinence from smoking at three and 12 months. A secondary outcome was forward movement in the stages of change cycle. RESULTS: The proportion showing sustained abstinence was 3.6% in the extended counselling group, and 4.4% in the brief advice group (difference = -0.8%; 95% confidence interval = -4.3% to 2.6%). Seventy-four (30%) of those randomized to extended counselling actually took up this offer. No significant progression in stages of change was detected between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In unselected general practice patients who smoke, brief advice from a GP combined with intensive intervention and follow-up by a practice nurse is no more effective than brief advice alone.","Comments":"LR: 20140615; JID: 9005323; CIN: Br J Gen Pract. 1999 Jun;49(443):486.

patches have shown considerable promise in improving smoking cessation outcomes. The present study assessed telephone support as an adjunct to a managed care-based, single-session group orientation smoking cessation program with nicotine patch therapy. METHODS: The unit of randomization was the orientation session (n = 35). Subjects (n = 509) were randomly assigned to a group session without telephone support, the session plus access to a toll-free help line, or the session with telephone help line plus active telephone outreach. RESULTS: Contrary to hypothesis, there were no differences between treatment conditions. Overall abstinence rates were 22% at 6 months and 21% at 1 year. Fewer than 1% of eligible subjects called the toll-free help line. An average of 3.8 of a possible 4 calls were completed in the telephone outreach condition. CONCLUSIONS: Abstinence results obtained in this program were comparable to those obtained with more extensive counseling. However, there was no evidence of benefit from telephone support beyond the initial physician-led group orientation session.","Comments":"LR: 20151119; JID: 1254074; 6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine); OID: NLM: PMC1381132; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lando H A; Rolnick S ; Klevan D ; Roski J ; Cherney L ; Lauger G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Administration, Cutaneous\r\nAdult\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMotivation\r\nNicotine\/administration & dosage\r\nOutcome and Process Assessment (Health Care)\r\nSelf-Help Groups\r\nSmoking Cessation\/methods\r\nTelephone","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507564,"AdditionalText":"Prior to randomization,\rsubjects had\rsmoked an average\rof 27.8 cigarettes per\rday and had smoked\rfor an average\rof\r23.4 years.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263163,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"27.8 cigarettes per day[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Lando (1997).pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507427,"AdditionalText":"Mean\rn\rMean\rn\rMean\rn\rFemale, %*\r46.6\r174\r61.3\r173\r60.5\r162\rCaucasian, %\r97.1\r172\r98.2\r169\r96.9 161","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263163,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Female,\"\n\"60.5[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Lando (1997).pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507413,"AdditionalText":"Female, %*\r46.6\r174\r61.3\r173\r60.5\r162\rCaucasian, %\r97.1\r172\r98.2\r169\r96.9 161\rSome college education, %\r46.6\r174\r45.7\r173\r43.8\r162","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263163,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Caucasian\"\n\"96.9[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Lando (1997).pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507448,"AdditionalText":"Caucasian, %\r97.1\r172\r98.2\r169\r96.9 161\rSome college education, %\r46.6\r174\r45.7\r173\r43.8\r162\rEmployed\rfull time, %\r79.9\r174 78.0\r173 76.5 162","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263163,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Some college education,\"\n\"43.8[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Lando (1997).pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507459,"AdditionalText":"Some college education, %\r46.6\r174\r45.7\r173\r43.8\r162\rEmployed\rfull time, %\r79.9\r174 78.0\r173 76.5 162\rNo. cigarettes on typical day,\r27.6\r172\r28.5\r171\r27.4\r160","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263163,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"76.5[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Lando (1997).pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":4507435,"AdditionalText":"Fagerstrom\rTest\rfor Nicotine\r5.2\r174\r5.1\r173\r5.0\r162\rDependence\rAge,y\r41.3\r168\r42.9\r170\r41.6\r156\rNote.\rThe statistical\rsignificance of mean differences in baseline\rsubject\rcharacteristics was","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263163,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"41.6[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Lando (1997).pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":3675611,"AdditionalText":" PROSTEP 22-mg nicotine patches\r(Wyeth-Ayerst\rLaboratories,\rRadnor, Pa),\rwhich were provided\rfree to study partici-\rpants.\r++","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263163,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\" received prescriptions for PROSTEP 22-mg nicotine patches[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Lando (1997).pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":3675720,"AdditionalText":"The standard written\rmaterials de-\rscribing patches and providing recommen-\rdations\rfor appropriate use were provided\rwhen subjects\rfilled their prescriptions.\r+","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263163,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\" recommen- dations for appropriate use[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Lando (1997).pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint2"},{"AttributeId":3675717,"AdditionalText":"In addition to prescriptions for the\rnicotine patch, subjects\rassigned to\rthe\rhelp-line condition\rreceived a registration\rcard for\rLederle Support\rServices, which\rthey could complete and\rturn in at\rthe\rgroup\rorientation\rsession.

The present study examined the efficacy of moderate-intensity exercise for smoking cessation among female smokers. Healthy, sedentary female smokers (N = 217) were randomly assigned to an 8-week cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation program plus moderate-intensity exercise (CBT+EX) or to the same cessation program plus equal contact (CBT). A subsample received nicotine replacement therapy. Results indicated that the CBT+EX and CBT groups were equally likely to attain smoking cessation at the end of treatment, as measured by cotinine-verified 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (20.2% for CBT+EX vs. 18.5% for CBT). The CBT+EX group was more likely to report smoking cessation, as measured by 7-day point prevalence at the 3-month follow-up (11.9% vs. 4.6%, p<.05), compared with the CBT group. No group differences were found at 12 months by either 7-day point prevalence (7.3% for CBT+EX vs. 8.3% for CBT) or continuous abstinence (0.9% for CBT+EX vs. 0.9% for CBT). Additionally, among participants in the CBT+EX group, those with higher adherence to the exercise prescription were significantly more likely to achieve smoking cessation at the end of treatment than were participants reporting lower adherence to exercise. Our findings indicate that the empirical support for moderate-intensity exercise as an adjunctive treatment to CBT for smoking cessation may be limited. Perhaps future studies could compare moderate- vs. vigorous-intensity physical activity to test their relative efficacy.","Comments":"LR: 20071114; GR: CA77249\/CA\/NCI NIH HHS\/United States; GR: HL64342\/HL\/NHLBI NIH HHS\/United States;

bupropion SR and individual counseling as smoking cessation treatments was assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial among adult daily smokers. Bupropion SR treatment and counseling were fully crossed in this factorial design so that the efficacy of each treatment and the combination could be estimated, relative to a placebo medication and assessment control condition. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that bupropion SR increased abstinence rates at the end of treatment, relative to the placebo medication conditions, for both biochemically confirmed 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (OR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.04-3.72) and self-reported prolonged abstinence (OR = 2.90, 95% CI 1.66-5.06). Bupropion SR treatment also improved latency to lapse and relapse and improved the latency between lapse and relapse in survival analyses. Medication effects were more modest for both 12-month point-prevalence abstinence (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 0.74-2.92) and prolonged abstinence (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.66-2.72). Counseling was not associated with increases in the likelihood of abstinence at any time point (odds ratios ranged from 0.80 to 1.16 across abstinence outcomes in the full intent-to-treat sample). Counseling and medication did not significantly interact at any time point, and adding counseling did not improve end-of-treatment point-prevalence abstinence (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.68-2.03) or prolonged abstinence (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 0.75-2.12) substantially when offered in conjunction with active medication.","Comments":"LR: 20131121; GR: P50CA084724\/CA\/NCI NIH HHS\/United States; GR:

This study assessed the effects of a behavioral intervention promoting an increase in physical activity versus usual care in a pilot randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Disadvantaged smokers who wanted to reduce but not quit were randomized to either a counseling intervention of up to 12 weeks to support smoking reduction and increased physical activity (n = 49) or usual care (n = 50). Data at 16 weeks were collected for various smoking and physical activity outcomes. Primary analyses consisted of an intention to treat analysis based on complete case data. Secondary analyses explored the impact of handling missing data. RESULTS: Compared with controls, intervention smokers were more likely to initiate a quit attempt (36 vs. 10%; odds ratio 5.05, [95% CI: 1.10; 23.15]), and a greater proportion achieved at least 50% reduction in cigarettes smoked (63 vs. 32%; 4.21 [1.32; 13.39]). Postquit abstinence measured by exhaled carbon monoxide at 4-week follow-up showed promising differences between groups (23% vs. 6%; 4.91 [0.80; 30.24]). No benefit of intervention on physical activity was found. Secondary analyses suggested that the standard missing data assumption of \"missing\" being equivalent to \"smoking\" may be conservative resulting in a reduced intervention effect. CONCLUSIONS: A smoking reduction intervention for economically disadvantaged smokers which involved personal support to increase physical activity appears to be more effective than usual care in achieving reduction and may promote cessation. The effect does not appear to be influenced by an increase in physical activity.","Comments":"LR: 20160212; CI: (c) The Author 2015; JID: 9815751; 2014\/09\/02 [received]; 2015\/05\/04 [accepted]; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Thompson T P; Greaves C J; Ayres R ; Aveyard P ; Warren F C; Byng R ; Taylor R S; Campbell J L; Ussher M ; Green C ; Michie S ; West R ; Taylor A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093\/ntr\/ntv099 [doi]","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBehavior Therapy\/methods\r\nCounseling\/methods\r\nExercise\/physiology\/psychology\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMotor Activity\/physiology\r\nPilot Projects\r\nSmoking\/epidemiology\/psychology\/therapy\r\nSmoking Cessation\/methods\/psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nVulnerable Populations\/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507433,"AdditionalText":"Participants were eligible to enter the study if they were at least\r18 years old, smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day (and had done\rso for at least 2 years), reported that they did not want to quit in","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252982,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"18[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"2015 EARS outcome paper.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4507564,"AdditionalText":"Participants were eligible to enter the study if they were at least\r18 years old, smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day (and had done\rso for at least 2 years), reported that they did not want to quit in the next month but did wish to reduce their smoking, were able to\rengage in moderate intensity physical activity (walk without stop-\rping for at least 15 minutes), were registered with a GP, and did not\rwish to use NRT to reduce smoking.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252982,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"at least 10 cigarettes per day[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"2015 EARS outcome paper.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":3636321,"AdditionalText":"Ethical approval for the study was granted by the NHS National\rResearch Ethics Service Committee South West, in the United\rKingdom.

DESIGN: Parallel group, randomised controlled, multicentre trial. SETTING: 13 hospitals in England, April 2009 to January 2014. PARTICIPANTS: 789 pregnant smokers, aged 16-50 years and at 10-24 weeks' gestation, who smoked at least one cigarette daily and were prepared to quit smoking one week after enrollment were randomised (1:1); 785 were included in the intention to treat analyses, with 392 assigned to the physical activity group. INTERVENTIONS: Interventions began one week before a target quit date. Participants were randomised to six weekly sessions of behavioural support for smoking cessation (control) or to this support plus 14 sessions combining supervised treadmill exercise and physical activity consultations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was continuous smoking abstinence from the target quit date until end of pregnancy, validated by exhaled carbon monoxide or salivary cotinine levels. To assess adherence, levels of moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity were self reported and in a 11.5% (n=90) random subsample of participants, physical activity was objectively measured by an accelerometer. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in rates of smoking abstinence at end of pregnancy between the physical activity and control groups (8% v 6%; odds ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 2.10). For the physical activity group compared with the control group, there was a 40% (95% confidence interval 13% to 73%), 34% (6% to 69%), and 46% (12% to 91%) greater increase in self reported minutes carrying out physical activity per week from baseline to one week, four weeks, and six weeks post-quit day, respectively. According to the accelerometer data there was no significant difference in physical activity levels between the groups. Participants attended a median of four treatment sessions in the intervention group and three in the control group. Adverse events and birth outcomes were similar between the two groups, except for significantly more caesarean births in the control group than in the physical activity group (29% v 21%, P=0.023). CONCLUSION: Adding a physical activity intervention to behavioural smoking cessation support for pregnant women did not increase cessation rates at end of pregnancy. During pregnancy, physical activity is not recommended for smoking cessation but remains indicated for general health benefits.

Four groups of women were defined by the dichotomies pregnant versus non-pregnant and intervention versus control. The intervention was semistructured, using a flip-over and a booklet, and it was implemented in an ordinary sequence of consultations. The study involved 187 GPs in western Norway. The subjects were 350 daily smoking pregnant women and 274 daily smoking non-pregnant women, 18-34 years of age. The point prevalence abstinence rate at 18 months was 15 and 20% for pregnant and non-pregnant women, respectively, in the intervention groups, and 7% in the control groups (Ppregnant = 0.06, Pnon-pregnant = 0.006). Twenty-five per cent of the pregnant women and 34% of the non-pregnant women reported that they had reduced their cigarette consumption, but had not stopped smoking entirely. If we include all drop-outs as smokers, the continuous abstinence rate during 15 months was 6%\/0% among pregnant women (intervention\/control) and 5%\/1% among non-pregnant women. Stopping smoking was associated with having a non-smoking partner (P = 0.001), and being encouraged to do so by their partner (P = 0.004). The prevalence of both pregnant and non-pregnant women who stopped smoking was higher in the intervention than in the control groups. Pregnant women stopped smoking as frequently as non-pregnant individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Comments":"LR: 20061115; JID: 8500875; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Haug K ;

Smokers at two outpatient sites were assigned to one of three groups: provider intervention only (PI); provider intervention plus self-help manual (PI\/M); and usual care (control) group (C). The physician message emphasized the patient's personal susceptibility, the physician's concern, and the patient's ability to quit (self-efficacy). The nurse consultation concentrated on benefits and barriers associated with stopping, and on strategies for cessation. Telephone interviews were conducted with the 250 participants within a few days of their clinic visit and again at one and six months. Both PI and PI\/M proved to be superior to usual care in motivating attempts to quit at both one-month and six-month follow-ups, and logistic regression analyses indicated that participants receiving the self-help manual in addition to the health provider message were between two and three times more likely to quit smoking during the study period than were participants in either of the other study groups.","Comments":"LR: 20161019; GR: HL 30566\/HL\/NHLBI NIH HHS\/United States; JID: 1254074; OID: NLM: PMC1647206; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Janz N K; Becker M H; Kirscht J P; Eraker S A; Billi J E; Woolliscroft J O; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAmbulatory Care\r\nEvaluation Studies as Topic\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethods\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nSmoking\/prevention & control","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507435,"AdditionalText":"Mean\rage was\r46.3\ryears,\r62\rper cent were female (reflecting their\rpropor-\rtion\rof the clinic population), 55\rper cent were married;","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252891,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\" 46.3 years,[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Janz_1987_Evaluation of a minimal contact smoking.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4507433,"AdditionalText":"All clients attending two outpatient medical clinics at a\rlarge midwestern teaching hospital who were at least 18\ryears\rof age, smoked a minimum of five cigarettes a day, and\rwere\rwilling to participate in a study of health practices and\rsmoking were enrolled after informed consent had\rbeen\robtained.

Progress was assessed by smoking diaries, supported by saliva thiocyanate tests, before and after the intervention and six and 12 months later. Only the two group approaches showed a significant improvement compared to the control group immediately after the intervention; these differences were no longer statistically significant six or 12 months later. The group methods proved to be more cost-effective than the physician intervention. However, when different sub-groups were examined, such as heavy or light smokers, a different pattern of results emerged. For very heavy smokers, the physician-led intervention proved almost as successful as the group approaches. Overall quitting results were disappointing, but the programs appear to be more successful at helping people reduce smoking.","Comments":"LR: 20110128; JID: 0120300; OID: NLM: PMC2327514; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McDowell I ; Mothersill K ; Rosser W ; Hartman R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507433,"AdditionalText":"Average age of the study sample\rwas 36.3 (range 16-70); 60% were fe-\rmale; 45% had a university education;\r59% were employed fulltime, and\r54% were married.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252892,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\" 16[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McDowell_1985_A randomized trial of three approaches.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4507435,"AdditionalText":"Average age of the study sample\rwas 36.3 (range 16-70); 60% were fe-\rmale; 45% had a university education;\r59% were employed fulltime, and\r54% were married.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252892,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\" 36.3[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McDowell_1985_A randomized trial of three approaches.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4507434,"AdditionalText":"Average age of the study sample\rwas 36.3 (range 16-70); 60% were fe-\rmale; 45% had a university education;\r59% were employed fulltime, and\r54% were married.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252892,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"70[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McDowell_1985_A randomized trial of three approaches.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4507427,"AdditionalText":"Average age of the study sample\rwas 36.3 (range 16-70); 60% were fe-\rmale; 45% had a university education;\r59% were employed fulltime, and\r54% were married.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252892,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\" fe- male[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McDowell_1985_A randomized trial of three approaches.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":3636306,"AdditionalText":"Patients\rwho were routinely sche-\rduled for\ran appointment with their\rfamily physician and\rwho met the fol-\rlowing criteria served as subjects:\r1.

In the treatment group 33% of patients became abstainers at six months compared with 3% in the control group. Self-reports of smoking status were verified by blood tests. Patients were more successful if they attended the first three visits compared with those who did not fully attend (48%: 6%). Continuing smokers had significantly higher blood concentrations of cotinine, thiocyanate and carboxyhaemoglobin per cigarette smoked at six months than at entry, despite a 30% decrease in stated cigarette consumption. This suggests that when smokers reduce the number of cigarettes smoked they compensate by increased inhalation. If general practitioners in Australia widely used the intervention programme with similar success this could have a major impact on the smoking habits of the three million smokers in Australia between 16 and 65 years of age. The total cost of the visits is a fraction of the medical treatment for a cigarette-related disease.","Comments":"LR: 20131121; JID: 7802871; 0 (Thiocyanates); 302-04-5 (thiocyanate); 9061-29-4 (Carboxyhemoglobin); K5161X06LL (Cotinine); ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Richmond R ; Webster I ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nCarboxyhemoglobin\/analysis\r\nCotinine\/blood\r\nEvaluation Studies as Topic\r\nFamily Practice\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nPhysician's Role\r\nSmoking\/prevention & control\r\nSpirometry\r\nThiocyanates\/blood","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507427,"AdditionalText":"There were more males in treatment group\rA (55%) than in groups B (34%) or C (44%).

After one year, 51% of the intervention group reported that they were not smoking any cigarettes, and most of the others reported a reduction. Compared with the \"normal care\" group, the men in the intervention group showed a decline in the prevalence of sputum production and dyspnoea; ventilatory function did not improve but its rate of decline was significantly slowed. There were no evident effects on blood pressure levels, nor on electrocardiographic findings over three years, nor on sickness absence over one year. Mortality follow-up has continued for an average of 7.9 years; 98 (13.7%) of the intervention group have died, compared with 94 (12.9%) of the \"normal care\" group. The 95% confidence limits on mortality range from 2.63% in favour of intervention to 4.37% in favour of normal care. The power of the trial has been reduced by smoking cessation in the \"normal care\" group. It is concluded that smoking cessation in these middle-aged men improved the symptoms and progress of chronic bronchitis; but the reversibility of the risk of cigarettes to the smoker's life may have been overestimated in observational studies.","Comments":"LR: 20091118; JID: 7806055; OID: NLM: PMC1060968; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rose G ; Hamilton P J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Absenteeism\r\nBlood Pressure\r\nBronchitis\/prevention & control\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nCoronary Disease\/prevention & control\r\nDyspnea\/prevention & control\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRespiratory Function Tests\r\nSmoking\/mortality\/prevention & control","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507427,"AdditionalText":"A\rrandomised controlled\rtrial of smoking cessation is reported in 1445 male smokers\raged 40-59\rat high risk of cardiorespiratory disease. ; The participants were\rdrawn from men who had\rundergone a cardiorespiratory\rscreening examin-\ration in the Whitehall study of male civil\rservants \rin London.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252899,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"male[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rose_1978_A randomised controlled trial of the.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4507433,"AdditionalText":"A\rrandomised controlled\rtrial of smoking cessation is reported in 1445 male smokers\raged 40-59\rat high risk of cardiorespiratory disease.\r","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252899,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"40[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rose_1978_A randomised controlled trial of the.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4507434,"AdditionalText":"A\rrandomised controlled\rtrial of smoking cessation is reported in 1445 male smokers\raged 40-59\rat high risk of cardiorespiratory disease.\r","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252899,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"59[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rose_1978_A randomised controlled trial of the.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4507435,"AdditionalText":"Mean\rage (years)\r52 8 53.0","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252899,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"52 8\"\n\"53.0[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rose_1978_A randomised controlled trial of the.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4266746,"AdditionalText":"The participants were\rdrawn from men who had\rundergone a cardiorespiratory\rscreening examin-\r in the Whitehall study of male civil\rservants \rin London.

DESIGN: The study was a randomised controlled trial. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: The subjects were 1445 male smokers, initially aged 40-59 years, who were selected from the Whitehall study survey of 16,016 civil servants on the basis of a high risk of cardiorespiratory disease. MAIN RESULTS: During the next 20 years there were 620 deaths (231 from coronary heart disease), 96 cases of lung cancer, and 159 other cancers. Comparing the intervention with the normal care group, total mortality was 7% lower, fatal coronary heart disease was 13% lower, and lung cancer (deaths+registrations) was 11% lower. An excess rate for other cancers, reported previously, did not persist into the second decade of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with observational studies, implying that smoking cessation by middle aged men substantially improves their changes of avoiding lung cancer or a fatal heart attack. Our estimate from the trial is that out of every 100 men who stopped smoking, between six and 10 were in consequence alive 20 years later.","Comments":"LR: 20100324; JID: 7909766; OID: NLM: PMC1059498; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rose G ; Colwell L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCoronary Disease\/mortality\r\nHealth Education\r\nHumans\r\nLung Diseases\/mortality\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nSmoking\/mortality\/prevention & control\r\nSmoking Cessation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507427,"AdditionalText":"The\rsubjects\rwere\r1445 male smokers,\rinitially aged 40-59\ryears,\rwho were selected from the Whitehall\rstudy\rsurvey\rof 16 016 civil servants on the\rbasis of a high risk of cardiorespiratory\rdisease.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252900,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"male[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rose_1992_Randomised controlled trial of anti smoking.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4507433,"AdditionalText":"Table II\rpresents the findings for two separate\rage groups (40-49 and 50-59 years at entry; ie,\r60-69 and\r70-79\ryears for\rsurvivors).","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252900,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"60[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rose_1992_Randomised controlled trial of anti smoking.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":3587190,"AdditionalText":"-The aim was to\rmeasure\rexperimentally the effects\rin middle aged\rmen of stopping smoking.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252900,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"stopping smoking.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rose_1992_Randomised controlled trial of anti smoking.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4507434,"AdditionalText":"Table II\rpresents the findings for two separate\rage groups (40-49 and 50-59 years at entry; ie,\r60-69 and\r70-79\ryears for\rsurvivors).","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252900,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"79[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rose_1992_Randomised controlled trial of anti smoking.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":3636305,"AdditionalText":"The results\rwere used to select the 1445 cigarette\rsmokers\rwith the highest\rcardiorespiratory risk\rscores,\rwho\rwere randomly\rallocated to intervention (714\rmen) or normal\rcare (731 men).","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252900,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"smokers[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rose_1992_Randomised controlled trial of anti smoking.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":3673298,"AdditionalText":"Those in the\rintervention\rgroup received\rindividual advice on\rthe relation of\rsmoking to health.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252900,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\" received individual advice on the relation of smoking to health.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rose_1992_Randomised controlled trial of anti smoking.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4022911,"AdditionalText":"Details were published\rpreviously.' ; \r1\rRose G, Hamilton PJS.

Adequate data for follow-up were obtained from 1884 patients (88%) at one month and 1567 (73%) at one year. Changes in motivation and intention to stop smoking were evident immediately after advice was given. Of the people who stopped smoking, most did so because of the advice. This was achieved by motivating more people to try to stop smoking rather than increasing the success rate among those who did try. The effect was strongest during the first month but still evident over the next three months and was enhanced by the leaflet and warning about follow-up. An additional effect over the longer term was a lower relapse rate among those who stopped, but this was not enhanced by the leaflet and warning about follow-up. The proportions who stopped smoking during the first month and were still not smoking one year later were 0.3%, 1.6%, 3.3%, and 5.1% in the four groups respectively (P <0.001).The results suggest that any GP who adopts this simple routine could expect about 25 long-term successes yearly. If all GPs in the UK participated the yield would exceed half a million ex-smokers a year. This target could not be matched by increasing the present 50 or so special withdrawal clinics to 10 000.","Comments":"LR: 20101026; JID: 0372673; OID: NLM: PMC1595592; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Russell M A; Wilson C ; Taylor C ; Baker C D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAttitude\r\nCounseling\r\nEvaluation Studies as Topic\r\nFamily Practice\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nLondon\r\nMotivation\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nSmoking\/prevention & control\/psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507433,"AdditionalText":"The\rsample comprised all cigarette smokers aged 16 or more who\rattended the surgeries to see a doctor during the four weeks 29 April\rto\r26 May 1974.

was designed to see whether the offer and prescription of nicotine chewing gum would enhance the efficacy of general practitioners' advice to stop smoking. A sample of 1938 cigarette smokers who attended the surgeries of 34 general practitioners in six group practices were assigned by week of attendance (in a balanced design) to one of three groups: (a) non-intervention controls, (b) advice plus booklet, and (c) advice plus booklet plus the offer of nicotine gum. Follow up was done after four months and one year. The results show a clear advantage for those offered the nicotine gum (p less than 0.001). After correction for those who refused or failed chemical validation and those who switched from cigarettes to a pipe or cigars, the proportions who were abstinent at four months and still abstinent at one year were 3.9%, 4.1%, and 8.8% in the three groups, respectively. These percentages are based on all cigarette smokers who attended the surgeries including those who did not wish to stop and those in the gum group who did not try the gum (47%). The effect of the offer and prescription of gum was to motivate more smokers to try to stop, to increase the success rate among those who tried, and to reduce the relapse rate of those who stopped. The self selected subgroup of 8% who used more than one box of 105 pieces of gum achieved a success rate of 24%. It would be feasible and effective for general practitioners to include the offer of nicotine gum and brief instructions on its use as part of a minimal intervention routine with all cigarette smokers. A general practitioner who adopts such a routine with similar success could expect to achieve about 35-40 long term ex-smokers a year and so save the lives of about 10 of them. If replicated by all general practitioners throughout the country the yield of ex-smokers would be about one million a year.","Comments":"LR: 20151119; JID: 8302911; 0 (Chewing Gum); 6M3C89ZY6R

cancer patients increases the risk of relapse, diminishes treatment efficacy, and worsens quality of life, about one third of patients who smoked before their diagnosis continue to smoke. Because patients have regular contact with oncologists, the efficacy of a physician-based smoking cessation treatment was evaluated. METHODS: Cancer patients (n = 432) were randomly assigned to either usual care or a National Institutes of Health (NIH) physician-based smoking intervention. The primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 and 12 months after study entry. RESULTS: At the 6-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in quit rates between the usual care (11.9%) and intervention (14.4%) groups, and there was no significant difference between the usual care (13.6%) and intervention (13.3%) groups at the 12-month follow-up. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 6 months if they had head and neck or lung cancer, began smoking after the age of 16, reported at baseline using a cessation self-help guide or treatment in the last 6 months, and showed greater baseline desire to quit. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 12 months if they smoked 15 or fewer cigarettes per day, had head and neck or lung cancer, tried a group cessation program, and showed greater baseline desire to quit. Finally, there was greater adherence among physicians to the NIH model for physician smoking treatment for patients in the intervention versus the usual care group. CONCLUSION: While training physicians to provide smoking cessation treatment to cancer patients can enhance physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines, physician smoking cessation interventions fail to yield significant gains in long-term quit rates among cancer patients.","Comments":"LR: 20161102;

DESIGN: Randomised controlled clinical trial. SETTING: General practices in Newcastle, Australia. PATIENTS: 311 Patients identified as smokers by a screening question were enrolled in the study. Of these, 101 were assigned to a structured behavioural change programme, 104 to a simple advice programme adapted from previous research, and 106 to a control group. No significant differences were found between groups for demographic and smoking related variables before the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the simple advice group received a brief statement of advice from the general practitioner as well as three pamphlets; those in the structured intervention group were given strategies which included attitude and behavioural change programmes as well as techniques to aid compliance. The amount of smoking in all groups was assessed by self reports with validation by measurement of salivary cotinine concentrations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Significant increase in cessation rates. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences between controls and the structured behavioural change group were found at the one month follow up, but only for self reported abstinence. The simple advice programme did not produce any significant differences over the control group. General practitioner evaluation of the structured programme highlighted difficulties in relation to the duration of the intervention. Overall the structured programme in its present form did not appear to be an effective programme for use within general practice.","Comments":"LR: 20141120; JID: 8900488; OID: NLM: PMC1663307; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Slama K ; Redman S ; Perkins J ; Reid A L; Sanson-Fisher R W; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAttitude of Health Personnel\r\nAttitude to Health\r\nBehavior Therapy\r\nConsumer Behavior\r\nCounseling\r\nFamily Practice\r\nHumans\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nPatient Education as Topic\r\nPrognosis\r\nProgram Evaluation\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSmoking\/prevention & control","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":4507433,"AdditionalText":"Patients were approached\rwhile awaiting their\rconsultation and were included if\rthey were self\rreported smokers, were aged 18-64\ryears, and could read and speak English.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252908,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"18[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Slama_1990_The effectiveness of two smoking cessation.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4507434,"AdditionalText":"Patients were approached\rwhile awaiting their\rconsultation and were included if\rthey were self\rreported smokers, were aged 18-64\ryears, and could read and speak English.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252908,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"64[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Slama_1990_The effectiveness of two smoking cessation.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":3636306,"AdditionalText":"The final sample size consisted of 311 smokers: 106 controls, 104\rin\rthe\rsimple advice\rgroup,\rand 101 in\rthe behavioural\rchange programme.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252908,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"smokers:[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Slama_1990_The effectiveness of two smoking cessation.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":3636321,"AdditionalText":"Setting-General practices in Newcastle,\rAustralia.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252908,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Australia[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Slama_1990_The effectiveness of two smoking cessation.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4266746,"AdditionalText":"Setting-General practices in Newcastle,\rAustralia.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252908,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Newcastle[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Slama_1990_The effectiveness of two smoking cessation.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4266759,"AdditionalText":"Setting-General practices in Newcastle,\rAustralia.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252908,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"General practices[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Slama_1990_The effectiveness of two smoking cessation.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":3587190,"AdditionalText":"Cessation - Self\rreported smoking behaviour\rwas\rmeasured in telephone or home based interviews\rconducted at one, six, and 12 months.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":252908,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Cessation[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Slama_1990_The effectiveness of two smoking cessation.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":3587192,"AdditionalText":"Biochemical\rvalidation of self\rreported\rabstinence was performed\rusing paired ion liquid chromatography analysis of\rsalivary cotinine concentrations.

METHODS: The preliminary efficacy of a behavioral exercise intervention that incorporated features designed to address prior limitations was tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Sixty-one smokers (65.6% female, mean age = 47.3 years, smoked a mean of 19.7 cigarettes\/day) were randomized to receive either a 12-week exercise intervention or a 12-week health education contact control. Participants in both conditions received an 8-week telephone-delivered, standard smoking cessation protocol (with the transdermal nicotine patch). Follow-ups were conducted at the end of treatment (EOT), 6- and 12-month timepoints. RESULTS: There were no differences between conditions with respect to the number of weekly exercise or health education sessions attended (9.3+\/-2.8 vs. 9.3+\/-3.0, respectively). While not statistically significant, participants in the exercise condition demonstrated higher verified abstinence rates (EOT: 40% vs. 22.6%, odds ratio [OR] = 2.28; 6- and 12-month follow-ups: 26.7% vs. 12.9%, OR = 2.46). Irrespective of treatment condition, higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous exercise were associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms during the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this small RCT point toward the benefit of a behavioral exercise intervention designed to address previous methodological limitations for smoking cessation. Given the potential public health impact of the demonstrated efficacy of exercise for smoking cessation, the continued development and optimization of exercise interventions for smokers through larger RCTs merits pursuit.","Comments":"LR: 20170220; CI: (c) The Author 2014; GR: K23 DA019950\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United States; JID: 9815751; OID: NLM: PMC4155424; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal,

This study was designed to determine the feasibility of a young-adult-oriented program, the X-Pack Program, when administered to college student smokers, and to estimate its effect on smoking cessation. Participants (N = 83) were randomized after enrollment to receive either a moderately intensive, E-mail-based, young-adult intervention (the X-Pack group) or a less-intensive program aimed at a general adult audience (the Clearing the Air group). Participants were assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after enrollment. Participants in the X-Pack group rated their treatment more favorably overall, were more engaged in program activities, and quit for more consecutive days at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, compared with the Clearing the Air group. Differences in quit rates favored the X-Pack group at the two follow-ups, but the differences were not significant. These findings offer some support for the X-Pack Program when administered to college smokers.","Comments":"LR: 20170220; GR: Z01 HD002110-16\/Intramural NIH HHS\/United States; GR: 263-MD-501757\/MD\/NIMHD NIH HHS\/United States;

Residential SUD treatment settings may be particularly positioned to target smoking, with ever-increasing smoking bans and culture shifts, but most smokers continue smoking. This study examined the effects of contingency management (CM) for increasing smoking abstinence in residential patients. METHODS: Smokers interested in quitting were recruited from a residential SUD program for men and were randomized to frequent smoking monitoring with behavioral support (monitoring; n = 21) or that plus smoking abstinence-contingent (expired carbon monoxide [CO] .05). Abstinence self-efficacy increased overall during the intervention and more with CM compared to monitoring and was associated with abstinence across conditions through follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: CM improved some measures of response to smoking treatment in residential SUD patients.","Comments":"LR: 20161215; CI: (c) The Author 2014; GR: R01 DA013444\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United

Participants aged 18-24 years were randomized to a brief office intervention (n=99) or to an expressive writing plus brief office intervention (n=97). Both conditions received four individual visits plus 6 weeks of nicotine patch therapy, which began on the quit date following the week 2 visit. Participants in the expressive writing plus brief intervention condition wrote for 2 consecutive days before and 3 consecutive days after the quit date. The brief office intervention group completed a control writing assignment. At end of treatment (week 8), biochemically confirmed 7-day point-prevalence abstinence for the expressive writing plus brief office intervention condition was significantly greater than for the brief office condition (33% vs. 20%, p=.043, OR=2.0, 95% CI=1.0-3.7, from a logistic regression adjusting for gender). At 24 and 52 weeks, abstinence rates were similar for the brief office intervention versus expressive writing plus brief office intervention (12% vs. 11% at 24 weeks; 11% vs. 11% at 52 weeks). The results suggest that expressive writing has promise as a smoking cessation treatment adjunct for young adults. Lengthier interventions or the use of boosters should be tested to extend treatment effects. However, participants reported a low level of enthusiasm for the expressive writing, which may be a barrier to implementing it over a longer time frame. Therefore, other modes of delivering expressive writing to young adult cigarette smokers should be explored.","Comments":"LR: 20151119; JID: 9815751; 6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine);

Low participation in vigorous-intensity physical activity programmes precludes their population-wide applicability. In a randomised controlled trial, we tested whether a population-based moderate-intensity physical activity programme increases quit rates among sedentary smokers receiving nicotine therapy. METHODS: Participants (n=481; 57% male; mean age, 42.2 years (SD 10.1); mean cigarette consumption, 27 (SD 10.2) per day) were offered a nine-week smoking cessation programme consisting of a weekly 15-minute counselling session and the prescription of nicotine replacement therapy. In addition, participants in the physical activity group (n=229) also took part in a programme of moderate-intensity physical activity implemented at the national level, and offering nine weekly 60-minute sessions of physical activity. To ensure equal contact conditions, participants in the control group (n=252) attended weekly 60-minute health behaviour education sessions unrelated to physical activity. The primary outcome was continuous CO-verified smoking abstinence rates at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Continuous smoking abstinence rates were high and similar in the physical activity group and the control group at the end of the intervention (47% versus 46%, p=0.81) and at 1-year follow-up (27% versus 29%, p=0.71). The mean weight gain after one year was 4.4 kg and 6.2 kg among sustained quitters of the physical activity and control groups, respectively (p=0.06). CONCLUSION: Participation in a population-based moderate-intensity physical activity programme for 9 weeks in addition to a comprehensive smoking cessation programme did not significantly increase smoking cessation rates. A non-significant reduction in weight gain was observed among participants who quit smoking in the physical activity group.

Smoking rates are higher among individuals with less than a high school education, those with no health insurance, and among individuals living below the federal poverty level. Despite these disparities, smoking cessation treatments for low-income populations have not been extensively tested. In the current study, the efficacy of 2 adjunctive smoking cessation interventions was evaluated among low-income smokers who were seen in a primary care setting. METHODS: A total of 846 participants were randomly assigned either to motivational enhancement treatment plus brief physician advice and 8 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or to standard care, which consisted of brief physician advice and 8 weeks of NRT. Tobacco smoking abstinence was at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months following baseline. RESULTS: The use of the nicotine patch, telephone counseling, and positive decisional balance were predictive of increased abstinence rates, and elevated stress levels and temptation to smoke in both social\/habit and negative affect situations decreased abstinence rates across time. Analyses showed intervention effects on smoking temptations, length of patch use, and number of telephone contacts. Direct intervention effects on abstinence rates were not significant, after adjusting for model predictors and selection bias due to perirandomization attrition. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating therapeutic approaches that promote use of and adherence to medications for quitting smoking and that target stress management and reducing negative affect may enhance smoking cessation among low-income smokers.","Comments":"LR: 20161019; GR: K01 CA160670\/CA\/NCI NIH HHS\/United States; GR: R01DA010860\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United States; JID: 9815751; 6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine); OID: NLM: PMC3954421; ppublish","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bock B C; Papandonatos G D; de Dios  ; M A ; Abrams D B; Azam M M; Fagan M ; Sweeney P J; Stein M D; Niaura R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093\/ntr\/ntt166 [doi]","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCounseling\r\nFemale\r\nHealth Promotion\/methods\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMotivation\r\nNicotine\/administration & dosage\r\nPoverty\r\nSmoking\/drug therapy\/psychology\r\nSmoking Cessation\/methods\r\nTobacco Use Cessation Products\r\nTobacco Use Disorder\/drug therapy\/psychology\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","Codes":[{"AttributeId":3669733,"AdditionalText":"The current study tested the relative efficacy of two\radjunctive interventions among low-SES smokers (uninsured\ror Medicaid) seen in a primary care setting.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263070,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\" low-SES\"\n\"(uninsured or Medicaid[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Bock 2014.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4266746,"AdditionalText":"Adult smokers were recruited during routine health care visits\rat three hospital-based primary care clinics located in separate\rinner-city hospitals in southern New England.","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":263070,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"New England[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Bock 2014.pdf"}],"SprintNo":"Sprint1"},{"AttributeId":4507435,"AdditionalText":" The\rsample was 68.7% (n = 581) female with a mean age of 39.6\r(SD = 11.4).

As an extension of our previous work, we planned to examine the synergistic effects of CBTD and bupropion on smoking cessation outcomes in general and among smokers with depression vulnerability factors. Participants were 524 smokers (47.5% female, M (age) = 44.27 years) who were randomized to one of four 12-week treatments: (a) standard, cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment (ST) plus bupropion (BUP), (b) ST plus placebo (PLAC), (c) standard cessation treatment combined with cognitive-behavioral treatment for depression (CBTD) plus BUP, and (d) CBTD plus PLAC. Follow-up assessments were conducted 2, 6, and 12 months after treatment, and self-reported abstinence was verified biochemically. Consistent with previous studies, bupropion, in comparison with placebo, resulted in better smoking outcomes in both intensive group treatments. Adding CBTD to standard intensive group treatment did not result in improved smoking cessation outcomes. In addition, neither CBTD nor bupropion, either alone or in combination, was differentially effective for smokers with single-past-episode major depressive disorder (MDD), recurrent MDD, or elevated depressive symptoms. However, findings with regard to recurrent MDD and elevated depressive symptoms should be interpreted with caution given the low rate of recurrent MDD and the low level of depressive symptoms in our sample. An a priori test of treatment effects in smokers with these depression vulnerability factors is warranted in future clinical trials.","Comments":"LR: 20161122; GR: R01 DA008511\/DA\/NIDA NIH HHS\/United States;
