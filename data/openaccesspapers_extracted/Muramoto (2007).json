      "value": "Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride for adolescent smoking cessation. Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial. Setting: Metropolitan areas of Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. Participants: Adolescents (N = 312) recruited through media and various community venues from March 1, 1999, through December 31, 2002, who were aged 14 to 17 years, smoked 6 or more cigarettes per day, had an exhaled carbon monoxide level of 10 ppm or greater, had at least 2 previous quit attempts, and had no other current major psychiatric diagnosis. Intervention: Sustained-release bupropion hydrochlo-ride, 150 mg/d (n = 105) or 300 mg/d (n = 104), or placebo (n=103) for 6 weeks, plus weekly brief individual counseling. Subjects were followed up at 12 weeks (by telephone call) and 26 weeks. Main Outcome Measure: Confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 weeks and 30-day prolonged abstinence (carbon monoxide level 񮽙10 ppm at each visit; urinary cotinine level 񮽙 50 µg/L at weeks 2 and 6). Results: Cotinine-confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates at 6 weeks were as follows: placebo, 5.6%; 150 mg, 10.7%; and 300 mg, 14.5% (P=.03, 300 mg vs placebo). At 26 weeks, confirmed point prevalence abstinence rates were as follows: placebo, 10.3%; 150 mg, 3.1%; and 300 mg, 13.9% (P = .049). During treatment, confirmed point prevalence rates were significantly higher for 300 mg than placebo at every week except week 4. Conclusions: Sustained-release bupropion hydrochlo-ride, 300 mg/d, plus brief counseling demonstrated short-term efficacy for adolescent smoking cessation. Abstinence rates were lower than those reported for adults, with rapid relapse after medication discon-tinuation.

Other studies estimate that only about 4% of all adolescent smokers attempting to quit per year are successful. Compared with smoking cessation research in adults, adolescent smoking cessation research is still in its infancy. However, results from most studies published to date have been discouraging. A comprehensive review of adolescent smoking cessation trials showed a mean quit rate at 3-month followup of 12% compared with 7% among control groups; however, because of methodo-logic differences among studies, comparability of outcomes was limited. Pharmacotherapy for nicotine withdrawal has greatly advanced treatment of tobacco dependence in adults. Despite growing evidence that nicotine withdrawal symptoms are an important barrier to adolescent smoking cessation, 10-12 studies of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adolescents are rare. Most recently, a randomized controlled trial of nicotine patch and gum demonstrated that the nicotine patch was significantly more effective than placebo at 2 weeks after the initiation of treatment, with prolonged prevalence quit rates of 17.7% and 2.5%, respectively (P=.043). These treatment effects were not sustained at 3-month follow-up. Other nicotine patch trials for adolescent smoking cessation have failed to show significant differences among treatment groups. Bupropion hydrochloride, the first nonnicotine medication approved for smoking cessation, was an important advance in adult treatment of tobacco dependence and has been studied in 2 recent cessation trials for adolescents. An open-label feasibility study of sustained-release (SR) bupropion hydrochloride in adolescents with comorbid attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and nicotine dependence showed significant decreases in cigarettes smoked (P񮽙.001) and carbon monoxide levels (P=.04) during the course of 6 weeks of treatment (150 mg twice daily), and abstinence rates of 31.25% after 4 weeks of treatment. Findings are limited by a small sample size and lack of placebo control, but they support further investigation in a larger controlled trial. The second study, a randomized trial, compared combined nicotine patch and SR bupropion hydrochloride treatment (150 mg/d) with nicotine patch and placebo. Abstinence rates between treatment groups were not significantly different at weeks 6 and 26 (23% and 8%, respectively, for patch and active SR bupropion; 28% and 7%, respectively, for patch and placebo); however, a decrease in smoking across groups was observed.\nBupropion has been more widely used in the treatment of attention deficit disorders in children. Notably, youths at greatest risk for developing nicotine dependence also demonstrate ADHD-like characteristics (including sensation-seeking, rebelliousness, and impulsive behaviors). Early studies of bupropion in youths were for treatment of ADHD. Two studies found bupropion comparable to methylphenidate as an effective treatment for ADHD and safe to use in children as young as 6 years. Side effects were minimal and included mild rash, drowsiness, fatigue, and nausea. None of the youths experienced seizures. Thus, given bupropion's demonstrated safety in youths and efficacy for smoking cessation in adults, we undertook a randomized, placebocontrolled study of bupropion for smoking cessation in adolescents.\nThe objectives of this trial were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 dosages of SR bupropion hydrochloride (150 mg/d and 300 mg/d), when compared with placebo, as an aid to smoking cessation in adolescents. We hypothesized (1) that abstinence rates would be lowest in the placebo group and highest in the 300 mg group and (2) that adverse events would be negligible in all of the treatment groups but lowest in the placebo group and highest in the 300 mg group.\n",

      "value": "The present study has a number of strengths: doseresponse study design, biochemical verification of abstinence, large sample size, and community-recruited subjects. The dose-response design was particularly important because key pivotal research on the efficacy of SR bupropion hydrochloride for adult cessation raised questions about a sufficient effect from 150 mg/d rather than 300 mg/d dosing. We hypothesized that youths, on average, would weigh less than adults. Therefore, assessing equivalency of a lower dose-on the basis of either efficacy or tolerability-is essential. Our results indicate that only the 300 mg/d dosage was more efficacious for smoking cessation than placebo, and the effect appeared to be limited to the treatment phase. At baseline, the 300 mg/d group had significantly more adolescents who were older, had a history of longer previous quit attempts, and smoked more cigarettes. We interpreted these differences as being indicative of adolescents who are older, more established smokers, who are now trying to quit. We believe these differences would tend to bias against finding a treatment effect; thus, we are more confident in the significantly higher quit rates for the 300 mg/d group.\nBiochemical verification of abstinence during the medication treatment phase of the study and at the 26-week follow-up visit resulted in quit rates that were consistent with, but an average of 14% to 23% lower than, selfreported outcomes. We are thus more confident in our outcomes as a result of verification.\nThe sample size was comparatively large fora youth smoking cessation medication study, thus resulting in greater power to detect meaningful differences, although we observed some possible trends (eg, the comparison between placebo and 150 mg) that will require even larger studies. However, a critical issue in conducting a larger study is the difficulty of recruiting youths into cessation studies. Community-based recruitment from real-world teen environments (schools, shopping malls, and teen clubs) was an essential strategy developed in response to inadequate subject accrual by conventional methods of clinical trial recruitment. Community-based recruitment ultimately became a significant study strength because it resulted in a more diverse study population (including minorities and youths not in school), thus increasing the study's external validity. However, we still struggled to achieve the required sample size. The increased diversity of the sample notwithstanding, generalizability is limited in that only 28.7% of subjects who completed initial screening were randomized. The most common reason for exclusion (44%) was lack of motivation to quit smoking. Future studies will need to consider recruitment challenges when planning timelines and recruitment resources.\nStudy limitations include modification of the study protocol (follow-up shortened from 52 weeks after the quit date to 26 weeks) to adjust for recruitment changes and a prolonged accrual period. Some characteristics of the more diverse community-recruited subjects could be associated with lower cessation rates. However, randomization should have equally distributed subject characteristics across treatment groups. Thus, we do not believe the main study outcomes were related to differences in recruitment.\nThe use of exhaled CO for biochemical confirmation of abstinence for all but the week 2 and week 6 (end-oftreatment) assessments is a limitation, due to CO's short half-life. Although the subjects were daily smokers (񮽙6 cigarettes per day), the cotinine-confirmed abstinence rates at the end of treatment were 50% to 65% lower than the CO-confirmed rates. The implication is that, even for ado- lescents who report daily smoking, the cotinine rather than CO level should be used to confirm abstinence in cessation trials.\nAnother possible study limitation is that study subjects received compensation for study participation, potentially influencing motivation for initial study enrollment and continued participation. Although this could influence overall motivation to quit, randomization would have resulted in a relatively equal distribution across the study conditions, so that motivation would not explain the differences between treatment groups.\nThe ability of study subjects to guess their treatment group, thus undermining the blind, is a potential limitation. However, only 10 subjects (9.6%) in the 300 mg group accurately guessed their treatment assignment. Across all treatment groups, there were no significant differences in the proportion of subjects who accurately guessed their treatment group.\n",

However, abstinence rates at the end of treatment were less than those reported in bupropion cessation studies in adults. The 150 mg/d dosage did not result in increased quit rates but demonstrated a possible trend in the direction of increased cessation relative to placebo. Both dosages were generally well tolerated. These results are critically important because few effective treatment options are available for adolescent smokers who want to quit. Despite the positive end-of-treatment outcome, subjects tended to relapse soon after discontinuing medication. This suggests a need to evaluate a longer dosing regimen in adolescent smokers, eg, 12 weeks, which would be consistent with current recommendations for treatment of adult smokers. In addition, further research is needed on interventions to prevent relapse, once medication treatment has ended. Nonetheless, this study provides hope for helping a generation of smokers quit before they become adults.\n",
