      "value": "Background: We evaluated whether providing health risk appraisal for Koreans (KHRA) in terms of 'health age' during smoking cessation program would effectively help smokers quit smoking or not. Materials and Methods: A total of 332 male smokers aged between 30-65 years old, registered fora smoking cessation program in a public health center in a city, were recruited and underwent a baseline survey from January 2010 to February 2011. They were then prospectively randomized to a conventional counseling group (n=165) or a KHRA group (n=167), and received conventional counseling or KHRA-based counseling for six months. Abstinence rates were identified through carbon monoxide measurement (at the 4 th and 24 th weeks) or urinary cotinine level (at the 12 th week). Results: The abstinence rate confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide was significantly higher in the KHRA group (61.1%) than the control group (49.1%) at the 4 th week (absolute difference 12.0%, 95% CI: 1.4%-22.6%). However, there was no difference in abstinence rates between the two groups at the 12th and 24th weeks. The predicting factors of 24 week's smoking cessation success were age, older than 50 years old (OR 2.02, 95% CI: 1.16-3.52), lower Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence scoreless than 4 (OR 1.84, 95% CI: 1.03-3.29), and higher Self Efficacy/Temptation score (OR 1.79, 95% CI: 1.05-3.06). Conclusions: Smoking cessation counseling with KHRA could be effective compared to conventional counseling in the short period of smoking cessation. Further study is needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of KHRA in tobacco dependence treatment and to establish the indication and target population of this tool.",

If a smoker quit in his/her 30s', the life expectancy would be the same as those who have never smoked. If smokers quit in their 40s', 50s' or 60s', the smokers could live nine years more, six years more, or three years more, respectively. Therefore, developing effective smoking cessation programs is important to prevent the public from tobacco-related diseases and premature deaths (.\nIn Korea, the first smoking cessation program that the government carried out began in 2004 within 10 regional health centers and the program expanded nationwide in 2005.

The nationwide smoking cessation programs and other tobacco control policies in Korea have achieved rapid decrease of male smoking prevalence from almost 80%, the world highest rate in 1980s, to 47.3% in 2011 from the Korea National Health and Nutritional Survey. Since 2006, however, the downward trend of smoking prevalence became slow and in 2010 the prevalence re-increased among the younger generation. In turn, the efforts to improve the likelihood of smokers quitting smoking are most needed.\nAs anew approach, adopted health risk appraisal (HRA) in terms of 'lung age' in order to improve smoking quit rate. The HRA with the concept of \"lung age\" was a psychological tool to show smokers the apparent premature ageing of their lungs. As an intervention, smokers were shown the change of lung Yu-Jin Paek et al Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, 4964 function between continued smoking and quit smoking. As a result, 12 months later, 13.6% of smokers in the case group successfully quitted smoking, while only 6.4% of smokers in the controlled group quitted smoking.\nMy Health Age is the Korean HRA (KHRA) and was developed by the Korean Academy of Family Medicine (see Methods section for the detailed introduction of KHRA) We adopted My Health Age to the smoking cessation programs and assessed how it effectively helped to quit smoking.\n",

      "value": "The current male smoking prevalence in South Korea is 47.3% as of 2011, thus developing effective smoking cessation program is essential for better tobacco control in Korea. We applied KHRA to the current smoking cessation program, which is mainly focusing on counseling, and *Analysis involving the participants who were both available and lost at follow-up; **Validated by exhaled CO measurement (at week 4, and 24) and urinary cotinine (at week 12); The average number of cigarettes smoked per day was controlled due to the mean difference between two groups; Self-reported abstinence rate was based on the 7-day point prevalence  found that KHRA was effective in short term (4-week follow-up), however, it was not in longer terms, such as 12-week and 24-week follow-ups.\nOur finding was similar with the existing literature. Biomedical risk assessment, including exhaled CO, lung function, and lung cancer sensitivity, was often employed for smoking cessation program, however, the approach did not make difference in the rate of successful quitting after six months ().\nA previous study found that the intervention group who had been measured exhaled CO during the cessation clinic and measured it again after 6 months was 1.06 times more likely to quit smoking compared to those who were not offered the measurement. However, the difference was not statistically significant (95% CI: 0.85-1.32) (). Other studies also found that using spirometry to test lung function was not effective (95% CI: 0.77-1.81) (. Another study which employed artery sonography in order to show smokers their plague into the carotid artery and femoral artery found that the case group who showed plague was 2.77 times more likely to quit compared to the control group and the difference was statistically significant). In turn, a second larger study of a similar feedback mechanism did not detect evidence of an effect). Meanwhile, who adopted HRA to improve smoking quit rate found that the HRA with the concept of \"lung age\" was effective. The effects of smoking cessation counseling using biomedical aids were controversial according to different study designs. The study of a structured motivational intervention using spirometry information in the primary care setting is now underway to determine its effectiveness).\nBased on Parkes's study design, we developed this present study with KHRA and the results suggested that KHRA for smoking cessation program was effective only for short term. The possible explanation that KHRA was not effective for long term cessation can be number of intervention and time of intervention provided. KHRA was provided to the participants on the second and sixth week visits, therefore, KHRA was effective shortly in the fourth week and may have been effective in the eighth week. More frequent and continuous booster intervention with KHRA may improve smoking cessation rates during the long-term follow-up.\nOf course, there are fundamental differences between our study and Parkes's study. The participants in the Parkes's study were recruited from five general practices and were not specifically motivated to quit. On the contrary, our study took people who were all motivated to quit and visited smoking cessation clinic voluntarily. So, the impact of KHRA maybe lessened in our study subjects as they were already motivated to quit smoking compared to those of the Parkes's study. Further study is needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of KHRA in tobacco dependence treatment and to establish the indication and target population of this tool.\nMeanwhile, we found that those over the age of 50 years old, lower FTND and higher SET score were the predicting factors for the 24 weeks smoking cessation success. Based on this finding we should focus on current smokers aged 50 years or younger, those who have higher FTND and those who have lower SET score to decrease the men's smoking prevalence in Korea.\nIn age-subgroup analysis among the participants aged over 50 years old, the intervention group showed better smoking cessation compared to the control group. Most smokers aged over 50 years old experienced that KHRA showed older age compared to their actual age, thus, the group effectively responded to the KHRA.\nThere are caveats to the study. Firstly, we hypothesized successful smoking cessation rate of the intervention group to 30% and 15% for the control group. Based on the hypothesis, we needed 163 participants for each group as the proper sample size. However, the difference of smoking cessation rate was about 10% which means that we needed at least 356 participants for each group. This smaller sample size may have affected the results. Secondly, we excluded female smokers because there were not many registered female smokers in the smoking cessation clinic. Therefore, the finding should not be applied to female smokers. Further study is needed to target female smokers. Finally, we could not measure biomarkers for all the participants because there were some participants who did not visit the center for the measurement. So we called them and used their selfreported records of successful quitting for the analysis.\nIn conclusions, given the re-increased smoking prevalence, in particular, among men in Korea, it is essential to develop a better intervention in order to increase successful quitting. We adopted KHRA for the smoking cessation program in a public health center and found that the smoking cessation program with HRA was effective for successful quitting. However, it was only effective short term. Further efforts and study are needed to improve the effectiveness of the smoking cessation program with HRA.\n",
