      "value": "found that measurements of peripheral atherosclerosis improves cardiovascular risk prediction, 1,2 but few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined the clinical impact of atherosclerosis screening. Evidence from observational studies suggests that screening for peripheral atherosclerosis and knowing its results might help motivate patients to optimize their health behaviors, 4,5 such as adherence to drug regimens, change in lifestyle, 7,8 and increase in their perception of cardiovascular risk. However, the interpretation of these observational data is limited by the lack of comparison with a randomized control group. Two RCTs assessing the impact of atherosclerosis screening yielded conflicting results. Although atherosclerosis screening with carotid ultrasonography (US) or a computed tomographic scan of coronary artery calcification (CAC) has passed into law in Texas and is increasingly used in clinical practice, 3,5 the role of screening for atherosclerosis in the clinical setting is still controversial. Given the limited RCT data, it is debated whether imaging should be considered only in certain subgroups of patients or extended to healthy adults, leading to controversial recommendations. Because many smokers stop smoking only after an acute cardiovascular event, we hypothesized that patients' knowledge of plaque screening results would enhance adherence to treatment regimens, 5,18 motivation for lifestyle changes, and subsequent cardiovascular risk factor (CVRF) improvement. Pictures of atherosclerotic plaques might have a potential educational/motivational role 4,5 by capturing a \"teachable moment.\" However, it is unknown whether carotid plaque screening represents a teachable moment similar to acute cardiovascular events. To assess whether screening for carotid plaques helps motivate smokers to stop smoking and improve their other CVRFs after a 12-month follow-up, we randomized 536 regular smokers to carotid plaque screening by means of US vs no screening (control group) in addition to a comprehensive smoking cessation program for all participants.\n",

Our primary outcome assessed whether US carotid plaque screening improved smoking cessation rates at 12 months. Our second outcome tested whether carotid plaque screening improved CVRF levels and overall 10-year cardiovascular risk based on the Framingham risk score (FRS). Smokers were randomly assigned to the intervention (US) group undergoing carotid plaque screening or the control group without screening, in addition to a comprehensive smoking cessation program for all. Carotid B-mode US (system 5; Vingmed/General Electric) was performed by a trained observer blinded to clinical information, according to a standard protocol. 8 Carotid plaques were defined as a focal widening of at least 50% relative to an adjacent segment, as recommended. Although the choice of a best carotid measurement for risk prediction is controversial, the presence/absence of carotid plaques is a dichotomized variable that might be easily understood by patients and potentially useful to motivate a behavioral change. Intraobserver variability for carotid plaques among 20 randomly selected subjects showed 95% agreement between the first and second readings (񮽙=0.89; P񮽙.001), similar to other studies. Smokers with at least 1 carotid plaque received 2 pictures of their plaques followed by a 7-minute tutorial on the significance of atherosclerotic plaques, as previously tested. 8 To ensure similar contact conditions, smokers without plaques and the control group received a 7-minute tutorial on smoking risks. Participants were asked to set a quit date within the week after US.\nFor both groups, participants underwent a comprehensive smoking cessation program for 1 year. As previously described, this program consisted of six 20-minute individual counseling sessions, 1 telephone call at 6 months, NRT patches tailored to individual needs, and brochures on smoking cessation.

We classified as current smokers those with carbon monoxide levels of at least 10 ppm or cotinine levels of at least 25 ng/mL (except if the participant was currently receiving NRT). The primary outcome was 1-week smoking abstinence (point prevalence) at 12 months. The secondary outcome was continuous abstinence from the quit date to study end. Smoking cessation ascertainment and tobacco counseling were performed by staff blinded to group allocation and US results, whereas participants could not be blinded, similar to previous screening studies, because the US result was the potential motivational tool. Participants' physicians were also blinded to group assignments and US results.\nSecondary outcomes also included the following changes in CVRF levels after 12-month follow-up: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, blood pressure, hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) level in diabetic participants, high-sensitivity Creactive protein (hs-CRP) level (smoking cessation has been suggested as a potential intervention for elevated hs-CRP levels ), and overall 10-year coronary heart disease risk by FRS. We measured weight, height, blood pressure, and levels of HbA 1c , glucose, and lipids after overnight fasting using standard methods. Plasma hs-CRP levels were measured by means of a highsensitivity latex-enhanced immunonephelometric assay (nephelometer; Dade Behring GmbH). Other outcomes included change in physical activity measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire previously validated in 12 countries and change in cardiovascular drug regimen adherence by the Morisky medication adherence questionnaire previously used in RCTs measuring drug regimen adherence.

A similar number of patients withdrew or were lost to follow-up among the randomized groups. Overall, 1 patient died in the US group and 2 in the control group; these deaths were unrelated to cardiovascular disease (suicide, drowning, and gastrointestinal tract bleeding). Fourteen participants were lost to follow-up, and 7 who had withdrawn their participation were classified as current smokers. The 3 deceased participants and 1 who had moved to an untraceable address were excluded from abstinence analyses, as recommended. At baseline, participants (mean age, 51.1 years; 45.0% women) smoked an average of 20 cigarettes per day, with a median duration of smoking of 31.7 years.

Furthermore, in the US group, smoking cessation rates did not differ according to the presence or absence of carotid plaques.\nOur study adds important information to the few trials that have assessed the impact of atherosclerosis screening. In contrast to previous RCTs that were limited by a low number of participants with atherosclerosis or the lack of biochemical validation of smoking cessation, 10,43 our RCT included the largest sample of smokers and smoking cessation was assessed objectively. A recent metaanalysis has found limited evidence of an effect of cardiovascular imaging on health behavior in primary prevention and called for higher-quality studies because most previous RCTs were relatively small (most trials with 񮽙200 participants) and included few smokers and because several did not record medications used during follow-up. Our results are consistent with a previous RCT that found no difference in CVRF control among 450 military personnel aged 39 to 45 years who underwent CAC screening vs no screening. 11 However, the prevalence of smoking and other modifiable risk factors was low in that RCT, and only 15% of their participants had abnormal CAC scores 5 compared with our higher-risk population with a 57.9% prevalence of carotid plaques. Our results were also consistent with the findings of a previous study 43 that detected no difference for 4-year smoking cessation rates (P=.64) and physical activity (P=.77) among 2137 volunteers randomized to CAC screening vs no scanning. However, the previous study included a small number of smokers (111 participants), and participants underwent only a single counseling session on CVRFs compared with 6 sessions during the 12 months in our study. Although CVRFs partially improved in their CAC group compared with the no-scanning group, the absolute changes were very small (systolic blood pressure difference, −2 mm Hg; LDL-C level difference, −6 mg/dL). Potential explanations for these differences were that these changes occurred in highly educated participants (postgraduate education, 91% vs 21.9% in our RCT) and were concurrent with the introduction of antihypertensives (P=.02; 18%-24% vs 0%-2.1% in our RCT) and medication to lower lipid levels (P=.06; 25%-29% vs 3.9%-5.3% in our RCT). Whether these modest changes would reduce cardiovascular events remains to be demonstrated because myocardial infarction rates did not differ between participants who received scanning and those who did not.\nFor smoking cessation, a recent Cochrane review found little evidence of increased smoking cessation rates by providing feedback on the biomedical effects of smoking 45 except a significant benefit of lung age feedback after spirometry (relative risk, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.24-3.62) and US plaque screening in an RCT conducted in the Seychelles islands. In the study by Bovet et al, smokers who were provided with pictures of their own atherosclerotic plaque had a higher smoking cessation rate (17.6% in the screening group [22.2% in those who had plaque] vs 6.3% in the group without screening). However, that study included mostly light smokers (mean, 10 cigarettes per day), biochemical validation of smoking cessation was not performed, NRT was not provided, and smokers were provided with one brief smoking counseling session. Compared with previous studies, smoking abstinence at 6 months was far higher in the control group of our RCT (36.4% vs 6%), likely owing to the intensive program of smoking cessation counseling; we obtained similar high rates of smoking cessation among the control group in another RCT using consumption of 1 to 5 total cigarettes since the cessation date was counted as continuous smoking abstinence, explaining why the rate of continuous smoking abstinence was higher than point prevalence abstinence at 1 month when some participants had smoked less than 5 cigarettes in the past week. US indicates ultrasonography.\nthe same program. We therefore cannot exclude carotid US as having no effect on smoking cessation because of the high intensity of our smoking cessation program per se. Whether plaque screening would have an effect on smoking cessation if counseling was less intensive (eg, in primary care settings) remains to be examined.\nOur study has several limitations. We included only smokers motivated to quit, and volunteers are generally healthier than random smokers, potentially explaining the high cessation rates in our study. Imaging results were discussed only once, which might have limited the impact. However, previous trials of the effect of subclini-  Abbreviations: CVRF, cardiovascular risk factor; ellipses, values are not meaningful because the numbers used to calculate them are so small; HbA 1c , hemoglobin A 1c ; hs-CRP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; MET, metabolic equivalent task; NA, not applicable; SF-36, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey; US, ultrasonography.

A higher score indicates increased depressive symptoms.\nmeasurements at 12 months, we used multiple imputation to assess the sensitivity of our results to these missing data and found similar results. The significantly larger decrease in LDL-C levels in participants with plaques vs those without plaques should be interpreted with caution. This difference persisted after removing participants treated with medications to lower lipid levels and maybe related to better diet or better drug regimen adherence or may have occurred by chance in the context of multiple analyses. We did not examine clinical cardiovascular events because such analysis would have likely required more than 10 000 study subjects. Our RCT has several strengths. Despite the fact that many smokers discontinue RCTs in case of smoking relapse, we had remarkably few dropouts (3.9%) compared with previous smoking cessation RCTs. Our dropout rate was also lower than those in several previous large studies of atherosclerosis screening and lower than planned in our power calculations (20%). Compared with previous similar RCTs, 10,11 we included a higher-risk population with a high prevalence of CVRFs and carotid plaques (57.9%) and performed a biochemical validation of smoking cessation.\nIn summary, our RCT demonstrates that the addition of carotid plaque screening to a thorough smoking cessation program is not associated with improved smoking cessation or better control of CVRFs. These findings are important, given the increasing use of such screening in clinical practice and the growing trend of insurance company reimbursement for this screening. Future trials should examine the effect of atherosclerosis screening on cardiovascular events, 3 although some have argued that such large and expensive trials may not be undertaken. Moreover, it should be evaluated whether atherosclerosis screening maybe helpful among smokers who undergo less intense smoking counseling or to refine cardiovascular risk estimates to better target preventive medications. Until such data become available, the benefit of atherosclerosis screening should be demonstrated in RCTs 4 before its use can be generally recommended.\n",
