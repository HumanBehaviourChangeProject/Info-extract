      "value": "Objectives Active telephone recruitment ('cold calling') can enrol almost 45 times more smokers to cessation services than media. However, the effectiveness of proactive telephone counselling with cold-called smokers from the broader community is unknown. This study examined whether proactive telephone counselling improved abstinence, quit attempts and reduced cigarette consumption among cold-called smokers. Methods From 48 014 randomly selected electronic telephone directory numbers, 3008 eligible smokers were identified and 1562 (51.9%) smokers recruited into the randomised controlled trial. Of these, 769 smokers were randomly allocated to proactive telephone counselling and 793 to the control (ie, mailed self-help) conditions. Six counselling calls were offered to intervention smokers willing to quit within a month and four to those not ready to quit. The 4-month, 7-month and 13-month follow-up interviews were completed by 1369 (87.6%), 1278 (81.8%) and 1245 (79.9%) participants, respectively. Results Proactive telephone counselling participants were significantly more likely than controls to achieve 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 4 months (13.8% vs 9.6%, p¼0.005) and 7 months (14.3% vs 11.0%, p¼0.02) but not at 13 months. There was a significant impact of telephone counselling on prolonged abstinence at 4 months (3.4% vs 1.8%, p¼0.02) and at 7 months (2.2% vs 0.9%, p¼0.02). At 4 months post recruitment, telephone counselling participants were significantly more likely than controls to have made a quit attempt (48.6% vs 42.9%, p¼0.01) and reduced cigarette consumption (16.9% vs 9.0%, p¼0.0002). Conclusions Proactive telephone counselling initially increased abstinence and quitting behaviours among cold-called smokers. Given its superior reach, quitlines should consider active telephone recruitment, provided relapse can be reduced.",

      "value": "Proactive telephone counselling involves counsellor-initiated counselling calls and maybe offered to treatment seekers after their initial contact or to smokers referred to the quitline. Yet only 1% to 7% of adult smokers use quitlines annually 2e4 despite about 40% of smokers making a quit attempt each year. Active recruitment strategies that involve recruiter-initiated contact with smokers, such as active telephone recruitment or 'cold calling', may increase quitline use given it is acceptable to smokers and can recruit almost 45 times more smokers to cessation interventions than media. Most randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining proactive telephone counselling recruited smokers seeking treatment. Of those that measured 7-day point prevalence abstinence the majority found a significant effect of proactive telephone counselling at 3 months, 18 22 but not at 6 months 15 17 20 or 12 months . In relation to prolonged abstinence a significant treatment effect was mainly reported. 8e15 Two trials revealed that proactive telephone counselling significantly increased quit attempts during the first 3 months. However, others reported no shortterm or long-term impact. In regards to reduction in daily cigarette consumption, proactive telephone counselling had a partial or no impact.\nSmokers who seek cessation interventions are not representative of the smoking population. For instance, quitline callers are more likely to be women, younger, higher educated, more addicted, have previously quit and be ready to quit within 30 days than smokers in the general population. Proactive telephone counselling trials with treatment seekers have limited generalisability to all smokers, especially since many included only smokers ready to quit within 30 days. 11e13 16 17 However, it is uncertain whether proactive telephone counselling would be as effective with actively recruited smokers as for treatment seekers. The cost of extending the reach of quitlines can only be justified if proactive telephone counselling of actively recruited smokers is effective and achieves acceptable cessation rates.\nA limited number of RCTs have evaluated the effectiveness of proactive telephone counselling among actively recruited smokers. One of two trials that measured 7-day point prevalence abstinence found a significant effect of proactive telephone counselling at 3 months, but most reported no impact at 6 months 28 33 and at 12 months. None of these studies reported a significant impact of proactive telephone counselling on prolonged abstinence within 12 months or quit attempts. 26e28 Proactive telephone counselling was found to reduce cigarette consumption at 3 months, 6 months 26 and 12 months. Of the proactive telephone counselling trials with actively recruited smokers, three recruited participants via mail, 30e32 one used mail supplemented by telephone and four used active telephone recruitment. The trials that used active telephone recruitment targeted a particular segment of the smoking population: women having cervical cancer screening, clients from a health maintenance organisation, parents with young children and general community smokers interested in quitting. Given active telephone recruitment could increase the proportion of smokers using quitlines it is important to examine the efficacy of proactive telephone counselling among cold-called smokers from the broader general population.\nThis study recruited adult daily smokers by telephone from the broader general population and assessed the short-term and long-term effectiveness of proactive telephone counselling on (i) 7-day point prevalence abstinence and prolonged abstinence, (ii) making a quit attempt and (iii) reducing cigarette consumption by at least 50%.\n",

      "value": "This is the first trial to assess the efficacy of using active telephone recruitment exclusively ('cold calling') followed by proactive telephone counselling among daily smokers from the broader general population. At 4 and 7 months post recruitment proactive telephone counselling significantly increased 7-day point prevalence abstinence. However, this was not sustained longer term. The North American Quitline Consortium recently recommended assessing quit rates at 7 months 36 however many previous trials have done so at 6 months. If we assume that our 4-month, 7-month and 13-month assessments are similar to the 3-month, 6-month and 12-month assessments in other trials, respectively, comparisons can be made. The 7-day point prevalence abstinence findings were consistent with trials of treatment seekers that reported a significant proactive telephone counselling effect at 3 months, 15 18 22 and 6 months 18 but not at 12 months. 17 18 Apart from two trials that reported much higher proportions, 15 18 our 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates for proactive telephone counselling participants at 4 months (13.8%), 7 months (14.3%) and 13 months (15.2%) were similar to those of treatment seekers: 10% to 15% at 3 months, 15% to 20% at 6 months 17 20 and 14% to 17% at 12 months. Our results were also consistent with most trials of actively recruited smokers that reported no impact of proactive telephone counselling on 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 months. Proactive telephone counselling significantly increased 3-month prolonged abstinence at 4 months and 6-month prolonged abstinence at 7 months but not for any measure at 13 months post recruitment. Given most trials with treatment seekers reported that proactive telephone counselling significantly increased prolonged abstinence 8e15 the present findings are only partially consistent. The proportion of proactive telephone counselling participants who achieved prolonged abstinence appears lower than corresponding rates with treatment seekers, 8 9 12 13 15 16 particularly the 12-month prolonged abstinence rate (1.4%). This may reflect that giving smokers who had not volunteered for treatment a month in order to make a quit attempt and achieve abstinence is not along enough grace period to facilitate measurement of prolonged abstinence. Research suggests that 3% to 5% of self-quitters achieve prolonged abstinence at 6 months. The intervention group's 3-month prolonged abstinence at 7 months (6.0%) and 6-month prolonged abstinence at 13 months (5.7%) were higher. Past trials with actively recruited smokers reported proactive telephone counselling had no impact on prolonged abstinence within 12 months, therefore this is the first time that significant prolonged abstinence findings with actively recruited smokers have been found at 4-month and 7-month follow-ups.\nMaking a quit attempt was significantly more likely for proactive telephone counselling participants than controls at 4 months post recruitment. However, this was not maintained longer term. Similarly, proactive telephone counselling increased treatment seekers' quit attempts in the first 3 months, 12 13 but not at 6 or 12 months post recruitment. 8 16 Unlike previous trials with actively recruited smokers, 26e28 this trial demonstrated that proactive telephone counselling can facilitate quit attempts in the short term among actively recruited smokers. The finding that proactive telephone counselling produced a significant reduction in daily smokers' cigarette consumption at 4 months but not longer term was partly consistent with   previous results with treatment seekers or actively recruited smokers that reported short-term and longer-term treatment effects.\nThe RE-AIM ('Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance') framework proposes that the combined effects of the intervention's reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation and maintenance determines the public health impact of the intervention. Given 52% of eligible smokers were recruited, 34 compared to the 1% to 7% of adult smokers calling quitlines annually 2e4 this trial dramatically increased the reach of proactive telephone counselling. Efficacy was also found up to 7 months post recruitment. However, there was no difference between the intervention and control groups in long-term maintenance of smoking cessation. This raises the question of whether the mailing of self-help materials to cold-called smokers is a more cost-efficient option.\nThe results consistently show short-term but not longer-term effects of proactive telephone counselling with actively recruited smokers. While intervention participants were receiving proactive telephone counselling their cessation outcomes were superior to the control group. More booster telephone sessions 23 over a longer period or re-enrolling participants back into quitline treatment 39 may have helped maintain the initial proactive telephone counselling benefit. Further research is needed to determine if such strategies would increase the efficacy of proactive telephone counselling with cold-called smokers longer term.\nLimitations included the following. First, that the reach of active telephone recruitment was restricted because the telephone directory did not contain unlisted or mobile phone numbers. Random digit dialling may have increased the reach of recruitment. Second, participants were not asked about their mental health or use of illicit drugs at baseline. Therefore, the potential influence of such factors on the proportion of smokers achieving abstinence is unknown. Third, no biochemical validation of self-reported cessation was conducted. An expert workgroup recommended that it is unnecessary for large-scale population-based trials without face-to-face contact to conduct biochemical validation. Given evidence that disconfirmation rates are low and do not differ significantly between conditions 41 the lack of biochemical validation is unlikely to have influenced the outcomes. Fourth, an untreated control group was not included because it was not appropriate to withhold treatment having actively recruited smokers. Fifth, the impact on participant abstinence of other household smokers using the self-help materials mailed to the control group or phoning the quitline to receive similar support to their intervention group housemates is unknown. Finally, tobacco control activities in NSW during the trial such as media campaigns, new graphic warnings on cigarette packets and increased smoking restrictions inside licensed premises may have improved outcomes but are likely to have impacted both conditions equally.\nProactive telephone counselling initially increased abstinence, quit attempts and cigarette reduction among smokers actively recruited by telephone. Given 52% of eligible smokers were recruited, 34 compared to the 1% to 7% of adult smokers calling quitlines annually, 2e4 active telephone recruitment has considerable potential for facilitating more successful quit attempts provided longer-term efficacy and cessation rates broadly similar to smokers seeking treatment can be achieved. Quitlines should consider intervening with smokers actively recruited by telephone, provided effective means of reducing relapse can be incorporated.\n",
