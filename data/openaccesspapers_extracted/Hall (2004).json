      "value": "Objective: Accepted treatments for cigarette smoking rarely achieve abstinence rates of >35% at 1 year. Low rates may reflect failure to provide extended and multi-focal treatment for this complex and chronic addiction. Using a chronic disease model of smoking, the authors undertook a study to determine the effects of long-term antidepressant and psychological treatment. Method: One hundred sixty smokers of ≥10 cigarettes/day were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions in a two-by-two (nortriptyline versus placebo by brief versus extended treatment) design. All subjects received 8 weeks of a transdermal nicotine patch, five group counseling sessions, and active or placebo treatment. Interventions for subjects in brief treatment ended at this point. Subjects in extended treatment continued taking drug or placebo to week 52 and received an additional 9 monthly counseling sessions, with checkup telephone calls midway through each session. Subjects were assessed at baseline and weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52. The principal outcome variables were repeated abstinence at each assessment after the first over a 1-year period and a point prevalence of 7 days of abstinence. Results: At week 52, point-prevalence abstinence rates with missing subjects imputed as smokers were 30% for placebo brief treatment, 42% for placebo extended treatment, 18% for active brief treatment, and 50% for active extended treatment. With missing subjects omitted, these rates were 32%, 57%, 21%, and 56%, respectively. Conclusions: Comprehensive extended treatments that combine drug and psychological interventions can produce consistent abstinence rates that are substantially higher than those in the literature. (Am J Psychiatry 2004; 161:2100-2107) Ci garette smoking is recognized as an addiction. Long-term abstinence rates are poor, averaging between 20% and 35% for the most intensive and widely accepted treatments (1-4). For most addictive drugs, the recognition that addiction is chronic and relapsing has led to treatment of extended duration, follow-up support, and, when feasible , easy reentry into treatment. For cigarette smoking, however, promulgated models have been inexpensive and time limited; these include large-scale community intervention trials (for example, COMMIT [5]) or brief courses of medications or limited psychological contact (1, 6). The few extended treatments tested for tobacco dependence have met with some success. Hays et al. (7) treated subjects for 7 weeks with open-label bupropion. At the end of open-label treatment, 59% of the subjects were abstinent and entered into the 52-week relapse-prevention phase. During this phase, the subjects received brief monthly individual counseling from research staff and either active or placebo bupropion. Point-prevalence abstinence was significantly higher in the bupropion group than in the placebo group at week 52 and at week 78, but the conditions did not differ at week 104. The median time to relapse was significantly greater for the bupropion group than for the placebo group. The Lung Health Study provided intensive psychological treatment plus 2 mg of nicotine gum. The subjects continued with the gum for 3-6 months after attaining abstinence , after which the gum could be obtained with physician assent. At 1 year, the point-prevalence abstinence rate was 35%; 28.6% of the sample were sustained nonsmokers at 1 year (8) and 22% at 5 years (9). In the Collaborative European Anti-Smoking Evaluation , the 15-and 25-mg nicotine patch was crossed with 8 versus 22 weeks of drug administration, and these conditions were compared with the use of placebo. No differences between the active patch conditions were found. The highest sustained abstinence rate was 15.4% at 1 year for the 25-mg patch administered for 22 weeks (10). In the present study, we used a generic inexpensive drug of known efficacy for the treatment of nicotine addiction -nortriptyline (2, 4, 11). We also provided psychological interventions. The design was a two-by-two factorial, with treatment length (12 versus 52 weeks) and doses (active drug versus placebo) as factors. The primary hypothesis was that extended nortriptyline would be more likely to produce repeated 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at weeks 24, 36, and 52 than the remaining three treatment conditions.",

Nortriptyline drug dose was titrated for each subject until a therapeutic serum level (50-150 ng/ml) was obtained. All subjects assigned to active nortriptyline received 25 mg/day for 3 days, followed by 50 mg/day for 11 days. The dose increased to 75 mg/day at week 3. At week 4, serum levels were assessed, and if a therapeutic serum level had not been reached, the drug dose was increased to 100 mg/day. At week 6, serum levels were assessed to determine the final dose. When the dose was titrated fora subject receiving active drug, the dose was also titrated fora randomly selected subject from the same cohort who was receiving placebo. Titration was performed by a physician who had no contact with the subjects or front-line staff. Front-line medical staff, internal medicine physicians, and licensed nurse practitioners were blind to drug assignment. Subjects met with clinicians at week 1 to start medication treatment and at weeks 2, 3, and 12 to review compliance and side effects. If a subject had relapsed, he or she was referred to a counselor.\nBrief versus extended treatment. As in our previous studies with nortriptyline (2, 4), brief treatment took place for 12 weeks. If subjects were assigned to one of the two brief treatment conditions, they were told of their assignment to brief treatment at week 12 and began a 5-7 day course of tapering from active drug or placebo.\nExtended treatment took place up to week 52. At week 12, the subjects in the extended treatment conditions were told of their assignment to extended treatment. Subjects continued with the drug dose reached at the end of the titration period up to week 52. Subjects could choose to discontinue the drug before week 52. Subjects taking drug at week 52 were tapered from the drug at that time. Subjects were blind to drug assignment throughout the study and not informed of their drug assignment until after the week 52 assessment.\nPsychological treatment was delivered by master's-level psychologists and health educators. In all four treatment conditions (active brief, active extended, placebo brief, placebo extended), the subjects initially received behavioral group treatment that provided health-related information, facilitation of group discussion, and development and continuing modification of a personalized plan to quit smoking. Methods used included monitoring of cigarette use and paper-and-pencil exercises focusing on health-related information, motivation to quit, decreasing relapse-related thoughts, informational handouts, and didactic presentations. Five 90-minute sessions were held during weeks 4, 5 (two sessions), 7, and 11, fora total of 7.5 hours of counseling time. In the extended condition, the subjects received group treatment as in the brief treatment conditions. Thereafter, in both active and placebo extended treatment conditions, individual counseling sessions were held once per month.

      "value": "The planned group size was based on setting the power at 80%, with a type I error rate of 0.05. The estimated effect size was taken from Hall et al. and factored into the anticipated attrition rate. Logistic regression was used to test the effect of drug/placebo dose and treatment duration on repeat 7-day abstinence. A twoby-two design was used, with duration and dose as independent variables and the primary hypothesis evaluated by testing the dose-by-duration interaction. A generalized estimating equation, a generalization of the classic linear model that uses quasi-likelihood estimation, was used to test the hypotheses about pointprevalence abstinence at weeks 24, 36, and 52. SAS version 8.02 was used for all analyses.\nTo ensure that randomization had not been compromised, we compared the four experimental cells on the baseline variables in using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-squares analysis for categorical variables. To identify potential covariates, we correlated these baseline variables with point-prevalence abstinence at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52 and with abstinence at all assessments versus no abstinence using point-biserial correlations. We included in preliminary hypothesis-testing models variables that had significant correlations with abstinence. These variables were eliminated if they did not contribute significantly to the final model. Determination of predictors of attrition from assessments was not useful because of the low attrition rates (week 12=2%, week 24=4%, week 36=14%, week 52=9%). To provide a comparison with earlier studies, we completed a chi-square test on active nortriptyline versus placebo at week 12.\nDifferences in weeks of medication/placebo dispensed were determined by a two-way ANOVA, with individual comparisons with the Tukey test if the overall F test proved significant. Differences in withdrawal symptoms between active and placebo conditions at week 12 were determined by repeated-measures ANOVA, with baseline level of symptoms used as a covariate to control for the general tendency to endorse such symptoms. Differences inside effects reported during the first 12 weeks of treatment were determined by comparing the number of subjects who reported the effect in the active and placebo conditions. During weeks 12-52, we included subjects in extended treatment only in the analyses of adverse events. For both sets of analyses, a series of chi-square tests-or Fisher's exact test if the cell sizes were small-were used. All tests for all analyses described in this section were two-tailed.\n",

As indicates, the effect of extended duration on obtaining consistent abstinence was greater for the subjects receiving active drug than for those receiving placebo.\nTo test the second hypothesis, we computed a generalized estimating equation analysis with missing data omitted from the model, as is currently recommended for longitudinal analyses. The duration-by-dose-bytime-of-assessment was significant (χ 2 =11.90, df=3, p= 0.008, N=160). Comparison of the parameters estimates indicated that the active brief condition differed significantly from the placebo extended condition (odds ratio= 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.30-0.75, p=0.001) as did the placebo brief condition (odds ratio=0.69, 96% CI= 0.49-0.95, p=0.02), but the extended active condition did not differ significantly from the extended placebo condition (odds ratio=0.81, 95% CI=0.60-1.09, p=0.17).

      "value": "This study represents anew model of intervention in which treatment is viewed not as a one-time event or a few brief sessions but as an ongoing process over an extended time period as befitting a chronic disease. The combination of pharmacological and psychological intervention produced some of the highest abstinence rates reported in the literature. The 1-year point-prevalence rate of 50% in the active extended condition is unparalleled, with the only comparable rates having been reported over approximately 20 years ago in an uncontrolled trial of rapid smoking. There are, of course, factors that might have contributed to this rate, other than the interventions. These include low to moderate dependence, as evidenced by the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scores and self-selection into the trial.\nThe intervention used in the current study differs from others reported in the literature in that it not only combines modalities, but it provides them for an extended time period, independent of the subjects' abstinence status over that time period. Analyses of point-prevalence data suggest that extended counseling with placebo does not differ significantly from extended counseling with active drug. Active drug plus extended counseling is superior in helping smokers achieve repeated abstinence, however. Since repeated abstinence is considered a better outcome than single point-prevalence outcome, we suggest that extended counseling is most important in attaining abstinence, but more reliable abstinence will be attained by combining drug and counseling.\nNortriptyline does not have a U.S. Food and Drug Administration indication for cigarette smoking. It would be interesting, therefore, to attempt to replicate the findings of the current study with sustained-release bupropion.\nThere were differences between active drug and placebo in the number of side effects during the first 12 weeks of treatment on seven of 22 possible symptoms, including sexual difficulties, that were reported by 20% of the subjects receiving nortriptyline. During the extended treatment period, there were fewer differences between the subjects in the active and placebo conditions, and the actual number of participants reporting them was low in all conditions. The number and pattern of side effects experienced is worth noting, however, and maybe a barrier to nortriptyline use for some. Nortriptyline is an inexpensive generic drug that can be used safely with many smokers, and extended treatment with it may provide additional aid in maintaining abstinence.\nHigh abstinence rates achieved at week 12, which we believe reflect the combination of two pharmacological treatments, nortriptyline with nicotine-replacement therapy and psychological intervention, contributed to the high overall rate; extended treatment appears to have reduced the rate of relapse.\nWe also attribute the high abstinence rates obtained to the use of psychological counseling and regular phone contacts. The extent to which this level of counseling is necessary or cost-effective has not been studied. Although some might argue that the expense and time of extended treatments would preclude widespread implementation, even a relatively expensive smoking treatment is likely to be among the most cost-effective of medical interventions, given the high healthcare costs of tobacco use. Data such as these may show chronic smokers and their providers that such an effort is needed for successful cessation. One question raised by these data is whether the differences observed are maintained in a longer follow-up period. A second question, more relevant to a chronic disease model, is whether extended treatment would continue to have beneficial effects when provided over a more prolonged period or indefinitely.\nA history of major depressive disorder correlated significantly with consistent abstinence. The magnitude of the correlation was small (-0.15), however. This may represent a chance finding.\nThere were significant differences between nortriptyline and placebo at week 12, but inspection of the data suggested that they did not endure. This is in contrast to earlier findings by our group and others indicating a significant effect on point-prevalence abstinence for nortriptyline. Psychological intervention during the brief treatment period was comparable in the three studies. It is possible that the use of the nicotine patch swamped the effects due to nortriptyline, but if so, it is puzzling that the effect was not evident at week 12, immediately after termination of nicotine-replacement therapy.\nIt can be argued that many smokers may not be willing to engage in such intensive, long-term treatment. We propose that publication of data such as these maybe needed to convince practitioners (and smokers) that substantial abstinence rates can be achieved, but treatment commensurate with tobacco's addictive properties is required. Thus \"generalizability\" maybe a moving target that can only be assessed after results such as these are widely disseminated.\nThis study is unusual in that the results of blinding were reported. When they are reported, however, it is not unusual for subjects to be able to guess their treatments. This is probably the rule, rather than the exception for behaviorally active drugs.\n",
