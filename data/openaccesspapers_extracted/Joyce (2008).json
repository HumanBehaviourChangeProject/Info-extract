      "value": "We used a longitudinal comparison trial to test the effectiveness of four intervention arms in seven U.S. states. The intervention arms were (1) Usual Care (participants received smoking cessation information only), (2) Provider Counseling, (3) Provider Counseling1Pharmacotherapy, and (4) a telephone counseling Quitline with optional Pharmacotherapy. Enrollment was conducted between October 2002 and October 2003, and the interventions were available for 1 year. Six-and 12-month follow-up data on smoking cessation were collected.\n",

      "value": "The goal was to implement a randomized design that, to the extent possible, would achieve national representativeness, and therefore wide generalizability. Randomization at the person level was impossible because two of the four interventions involved interaction with the participant's primary care provider, and contamination may have occurred if that provider was required to deliver two different services to his or her patients. Thus, randomization at the geographic locale level rather than at the person level was deemed the best possible approach.\nSeven states--Alabama, Florida, Ohio, Oklahoma, Missouri, Nebraska, and Wyoming--were chosen for the demonstration in order to mirror in aggregate the nation as best as possible in terms of a number of factors, including smoking rate, and proportion of population of age 65 years and older. These seven states also had sufficient numbers of older smokers for adequate statistical power to answer the key study questions. States were chosen so as to enroll a participant sample that represented the nation as closely as possible in terms of smoking rate and proportion of population 65 years of age. States that already had a telephone-counseling program were excluded. Five states were each divided into four geographic areas; Wyoming and Nebraska were combined and divided into four areas. Divisions were designed to maximize the likelihood that patients and their providers remained in the same area. Using a restricted randomization method, each area in a state was randomized to one of the study arms so that each state had all four arms represented within it. Data from the 1990 Census were used to assess the balance across arms with respect to percent of the 65 population who resided in a rural area, were white, and lived below the poverty threshold.\n",

      "value": "Subjects were recruited via standardized recruitment methods across the four intervention arms. A general recruitment message announcing new services for Medicare beneficiaries who smoke was disseminated through the media (newspapers, TV, and radio), community outreach efforts, and, in some states, through direct mailing. For example, over an 8-week period, a message was inserted in the Medicare summary notices mailed to all Medicare beneficiaries residing in the demonstration areas who received medical services in the preceding month, informing them of a demonstration that would provide smoking cessation counseling coverage through a potential new Medicare benefit. All Medicare-eligible primary care providers who practiced in the areas of the study were eligible for reimbursement.\nBeneficiaries were directed to calla toll-free telephone number where they were screened. Callers were eligible for the study if they met the following criteria: a current Medicare beneficiary in a fee-for-service plan with Part B coverage, age 65 or older, a current smoker, an interest in trying to quit smoking, and anticipated residence in the study locale for at least 9 months. If eligible, a baseline survey was administered, collecting information on demographics, comorbidity, and smoking history.\nThe enrollment center received 30,726 calls from 23,279 unique callers. Of the total calls, 13,143 (43 percent) were informational calls that primarily consisted of general inquiries about the program. 1 From the remaining 17,583 calls, 13,577 individuals began a qualification survey to determine whether the caller was eligible for and would consent to be part of the study. Among those individuals, 8,904 met the eligibility criteria and 7,354 enrolled in the study. The most common reasons for ineligibility were age under 65 (2,187) and participation in a managed care plan. More than 1,500 eligible smokers did not enroll due to active refusal (1,081) or because their call was suspended (469) and they could not be recontacted. This resulted in an acceptance rate of 31.6 percent relative to the number of unique callers and a rate of 82.6 percent of eligible beneficiaries who began the qualification survey.\nSome degree of imbalance was inevitable due to the nonrandom distribution of eligible beneficiaries within states. However, the largest imbalance occurred in the Provider Counseling arm due to low enrollment in Southeast Florida. This had a dramatic effect on total enrollment in the Provider Counseling arm because Florida represented about 40 percent of all eligible smokers in the seven study states. We explored several possible reasons why enrollment was lower in this area, including blocked telephone access from specific geographic areas. However, an internal review by the telephone company did not reveal any evidence to support this hypothesis. Most important to the validity of the findings, there were no statistically significant differences across treatment arms in beneficiaries health status, smoking behavior, and lifetime quit attempts. Provider Counseling 1 Pharmacotherapy beneficiaries received counseling as described previously as well as coverage for the nicotine patch or bupropion fora $5 copayment. To access the benefit, beneficiaries submitted orders with copayment to a mail-order pharmacy company contracted to provide this service. Beneficiaries using the nicotine patch received dosages according to the package insert, with most receiving recommended step-down dosages of 21 mg to 14 mg to 7 mg. If bupropion was requested, a prescription was required. Participants were allowed one refill (for a total of two 12-week courses) of either therapy.\nQuitline beneficiaries received coverage for telephone-based counseling, including two mutually exclusive options: a reactive hotline, in which participants called and received prerecorded messages or ad hoc counseling, and a proactive helpline, in which calls were initiated by the Quitline counselor at predetermined times. The counseling protocols were designed for people older than 50 who were trying to quit smoking and were tailored to the stage of cessation readiness for older smokers using evidence-based standards as defined by the 2000 PHS Smoking Cessation Guidelines (. Those who chose the reactive helpline had unlimited access to services during their 12-month intervention period. Those who selected the proactive helpline could receive five counseling calls per 12-week cycle, with a two-cycle maximum per year. Helpline participants also received (1) a Clear Horizons manual designed for smokers 450 years ( and coverage for the nicotine patch fora $5 copayment via the same mail-order pharmacy procedures described above.\n",

After 1 month, nonrespondents were sent a reminder and another survey. Continued nonrespondents were telephoned up to six times so as to complete the survey via telephone. The main outcome measure was 7-day selfreported cessation at the 6-and 12-month follow-ups. Pharmacy claims were collected by the pharmacy benefit manager, while use of telephone counseling was tracked by the Quitline vendor.

The first assumed that nonresponders were smoking at the time of each follow-up (). Because this approach may differentially underestimate the effectiveness of each intervention, smoking status was also imputed based on nonresponders' demographic characteristics, health status, and smoking history. A probit model was estimated on the probability of smoking among responders to the 6-or 12-month survey and the estimated parameter estimates were used to predict the smoking status of nonresponders based on their individual attributes.\nThe results presented here reflect intent-to-treat analyses, where smoking for the 7,354 enrollees in the MSSP is examined regardless of treatment compliance and response to follow-ups. The primary dependent variable is the 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence at 6 and 12 months. We present unadjusted rates of smoking prevalence, as well as adjusted rates that control for sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, marital status, household income, education), motivation to quit (stage of change), smoking history/dependence variables (daily rate of smoking, years smoking, # quit attempts, length of longest quit attempt in the past 12 months, length of longest quit attempt), and co-occurring conditions (counts of chronic conditions, heavy drinking).

Using imputed (higher) quit rates lowered the incremental costs per quitter by 35-40 percent. The analysis assumed that the costs of cessation counseling and Pharmacotherapy were borne by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regardless of whether those treatments were provided through the MSSP. This more accurately reflects the costs to CMS if any of the services were to become apart of a Medicare benefit, which would ''crowd out'' treatments currently paid for by other third-party payers or Medicare beneficiaries. These estimates are comparable to a prior analysis of working-age adults, which found that the average cost to the health plan per quitter ranged from $797 to $1,171 depending on the extent of insurance coverage for cessation services).\n",

      "value": "The MSSP is the first large-scale demonstration to test the effectiveness of three variations of a Medicare smoking cessation benefit in real-world settings. Each treatment significantly outperformed the Usual Care intervention by 12 months, and increasingly intensive treatments significantly outperformed less-intensive treatments, with the Quitline producing the highest quit rates. At the inception of the study, it was unclear whether anyone evidence-based intervention would outperform another. The results here are somewhat mixed, with the Provider Counseling arm failing to outperform Usual Care at 6 months, but not at 12 months, and the Provider Counseling 1 Pharmacotherapy arm outperforming the Provider Counseling arm at 6 months but not 12 months. Unequivocally, however, the Quitline arm outperformed all other treatment arms at both follow-up intervals. Rates of confirmed smoking cessation in the MSSP compared favorably with quit rates in the general population and were higher than expected for older adults. Further, differences across treatment arms were robust to abroad set of covariates and survey nonresponse. Although quit rates were highest in the Quitline, physician counseling alone or in conjunction with Pharmacotherapy was more cost-effective. The fact that Provider Counseling, which had the lowest quit rate among the three active interventions, was in some cases the most cost-effective treatment is not surprising. Interventions that are more resource intensive are typically more effective than less resource intensive programs, but the costs of the former tend to be proportionally higher than those of the latter. Different approaches to smoking cessation maybe more or less effective (and costeffective) for different groups or people. Seniors who successfully quit smoking while using high-intensity interventions such as physician counseling with NRT may not be successful with low-intensity interventions. The search for the single most effective or cost-effective intervention maybe misguided, for it presumes that all smokers have similar preferences in choosing a cessation method.\nAn important question is how our results generalize to the Medicare population given that enrollees in the MSSP were more motivated to quit smoking than the average Medicare-eligible smoker. Absolute quit rates at 12 months were 10 percent in Usual Care, 14-16 percent in the physician counseling arms, and 19 percent in the telephone Quitline. This suggests that providing coverage for cessation services would increase quit rates by 50-100 percent among older smokers motivated to quit, depending on the type of service.\nThe majority of Quitline participants had five or more contacts with a counselor. The Quitline counselors delivered a structured intervention tailored to both senior smokers in general and to the individual smoker's circumstances in particular. In addition to greater frequency of counseling received in this arm compared with the Provider Counseling arms, the intervention included support in the proper use of the nicotine patch and dealing with side effects. Thus, it is not surprising that this highly structured, proactive, and individualized counseling experience, when combined with the opportunity to use low-cost nicotine patches, produced superior outcomes.\nA larger increase in cessation was observed when participants were also given the opportunity to use Pharmacotherapy at minimal cost. This is consistent with meta-analytic studies, which have shown that use of the nicotine patch or bupropion significantly increases quit rates compared with placebo or minimal treatment (). This study is one of the few to directly manipulate the addition of Pharmacotherapy to behavioral treatment, and the results support the assertion that the addition is beneficial. proposed several hypotheses by which behavioral and pharmacologic treatments might combine to increase efficacy, including: (1) Pharmacologic treatment provides relief of withdrawal early on and provides the necessary bridge through the most difficult period, whereas behavioral treatment provides skills necessary to prevent relapse subsequently, (2) behavioral skills maybe specifically helpful fora subset of smokers, whereas pharmacologic treatment helps another subset, and (3) one treatment may increase compliance with the other.\nThere are two justifications for offering cessation services through healthcare providers. First, the vast majority of older smokers have contact with a physician each year, with multiple occasions to provide cessation interventions. Second, smokers who receive even brief clinical interventions demonstrate significantly increased cessation rates compared with those who receive no advice, and there is a dose-dependent relationship between the intensity of person-to-person contact and successful cessation outcome (. One disadvantage of a provider-based intervention is that clinicians do not take full advantage of opportunities to intervene with their patients who smoke. Only about half of current smokers report that their physicians have either asked them about smoking or advised them to quit). Providing adequate reimbursement for counseling services would remove an important barrier, but can substantially increase the costs of the program.\nA national telephone Quitline provides a single access point for smokers and has been shown to be effective. One disadvantage of a telephone Quitline is that treatment must be initiated by the beneficiary. One can, however, envision systems where healthcare providers refer their smoking patients to a free national Quitline while providing them with pharmacologic assistance, if warranted.\nOur analysis has several limitations. Most prominent was low enrollment in southeast Florida. While enrollees differed across intervention arms in a statistical sense with regard to race, education, income, lifetime quit attempts, and stages of change, the differences were modest in absolute terms. Further, we controlled for these factors in multivariate models and included binary indicators for each state. The fact that the unadjusted and adjusted quit rates were nearly identical provides strong evidence that the randomization process worked despite the enrollment problem in southeast Florida.\nSecond, we did not know the number of counseling sessions received in the Provider Counseling arms nor the quality of the advice. The initial 6-month survey asked participants about the number of Provider Counseling visits. However, to increase response rates, shortened versions of the follow-up surveys were sent to those who did not initially respond. The short-form surveys only asked participants whether they had tried any of the methods listed, and if they did, whether that particular quit method was offered as part of the MSSP.\nFinally, self-reported measures were likely to underestimate actual use of counseling services as participants may not recall whether counseling occurred, how counseling was reimbursed, or what constitutes counseling. Thus, we may underestimate the costs of providing coverage for cessation counseling by providers.\nIn 2005, Medicare began covering cessation counseling for beneficiaries diagnosed with a smoking-related illness or who were taking medications complicated by tobacco use. Further, the Department of Health and Human Services recently launched a national telephone Quitline for all smokers in the Unites States. The results of this study suggest that a fully integrated benefit structured around low-cost Pharmacotherapy in conjunction with available free Quitline services would substantially reduce the prevalence of smoking and smoking-related illness among elderly beneficiaries motivated to quit, at a relatively modest cost. Future work should examine the reduction in medical costs associated with cessation among older smokers to assess how coverage of these services affects total Medicare outlays.\n",
