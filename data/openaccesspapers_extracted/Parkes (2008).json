      "value": "A quarter of smokers develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 1 which is largely caused by smoking and is the fourth commonest cause of death worldwide. In the United Kingdom, half of the estimated 1.5 million people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are currently undiagnosed. According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the mean delay from onset to diagnosis is 20 years. Spirometry can detect obstructive lung damage in susceptible individuals after 20 pack years of smoking, typically at around age 35. Yet the average age of diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the UK is 55, despite widespread availability of diagnostic equipment. Early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with communication of lung damage to patients could improve targeting of smoking cessation programmes and improve quit rates in individuals most vulnerable to lung damage. A Cochrane review of the use of personal biomarkers (carbon monoxide measurements, spirometry, arterial damage) for the harmful effects of smoking, however, failed to find firm evidence that such markers could be used to increase the quit rate. A recent non-randomised observational study on the effect of communicating spirometry findings on smoking cessation concluded that \"a large randomised clinical trial is needed to answer this important question more conclusively.\" The concept of \"lung age\" (the age of the average person who has an FEV 1 equal to the individual) was developed in 1985 as away of making spirometry data easier to understand and also as a potential psychological tool to show smokers the apparent premature ageing of their lungs. We tested the hypothesis that telling smokers their lung age would lead to successful smoking cessation, especially in those with most damage.\n",

A core management group, comprising principal investigator, practice manager, two practice nurses, healthcare assistant, and a patient representative, was responsible for the day today running of the project.\nSampling and recruitment A power calculation indicated the need for about 300 participants to have 80% power to detect a 10% difference in smoking cessation rate (for example, 5% in one group v 15% in the other). Assuming an attrition rate of up to 50%, we aimed to recruit 600 participants. We searched computerised patient records from five general practices in Hertfordshire to identify people aged 35 and over who had been recorded as a smoker in the previous 12 months. We excluded those receiving oxygen and those with a history of lung cancer, tuberculosis, asbestosis, silicosis, bronchiectasis, or pneumonectomy. We sent a letter of invitation to participate in the study and a research information sheet. Two weeks later, we telephoned all those who had not already responded, offering an invitation to participate and to answer any queries.

These comorbidities were not used as exclusion criteria but to confirm baseline comparability of groups.\nAll participants underwent standard measurements of lung function (FEV 1 , FVC (forced vital capacity), FEV 1 /FVC) with a Micromedical spirometer. Reversibility of airways obstruction was measured according to standard British Thoracic Society guidelines (over 15% and at least 400 ml improvement in FEV 1 after 400 Âµg salbutamol via a spacer). 8 Both groups were told that their lung function would be measured again after 12 months to see whether it had deteriorated. They were not randomised until after spirometry had been completed. All participants were strongly encouraged to give up smoking and advised how to access local NHS smoking cessation clinics.\nWe used two instruments to confirm baseline comparability of groups: the St George's respiratory questionnaire and Prochaska's stages of change questions in relation to smoking. The St George's respiratory questionnaire is a validated questionnaire designed to be self administered under supervision and to measure the impact of respiratory diseases (in particular asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) on an individual's life. Like other quality of life instruments, it has the potential to identify a threshold response to therapy or compare the response to different therapies, or both. 10 Scores of 7 or below indicate normal lung function. We adapted stage of change questions (with permission) from Prochaska and DiClemente's model in which smokers are asked three questions and classified on the basis of their response as in the \"pre-contemplative,\" \"contemplative,\" \"preparation,\" or \"action\"' phase (table 1).\nRandomisation procedure A clerk (who then took no further part in the study) prepared 600 sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes, each containing a card with allocation group determined by computer generated random number (odd = intervention).

The examples illustrated show how the lungs can deteriorate more rapidly with smoking, as if they are ageing faster. Smoking cessation will not allow the lungs to return to normal but reduction in function or \"ageing\" will then occur at a normal rate. Originally, calculation of lung age was based on estimates developed by Morris and Temple with reference linear regression equations to establish the best method. 5 They showed that FEV 1 was the best test for calculating lung age mathematically (box). In practice, the lung age is automatically generated by adjustment of the settings of the spirometer.\n",

If lung age was greater than chronological age, we gave them the \"lung age\" in years.\nWe did not tell those in the control group their results but informed them that they would be invited fora second test after 12 months to \"see if there had been any change in lung function.\" If the examiner was pressed for more information, he or she could tell participants that they would receive a letter with more information from the research doctor within four weeks.\nThe principal research doctor (GP) reviewed all the results, checked the quality of the spirometry tracing, and considered the result in the light of clinical data.

      "value": "In 2001 a non-systematic overview analysed 12 studies that provided feedback on personal biomarkers as part of strategies to change behaviour in smokers. The authors concluded that success was likely to depend on how the information was conveyed and understood and how it related to behaviour. They also suggested that success might depend on graphic displays or written individualised information as well as the prospect of gain rather than negative messages about costs or disadvantage. A Cochrane review of the evidence for the effectiveness of biomarkers in smoking cessation was published in October 2005. Observational studies were included in the background discussion but only randomised controlled trials were included in the analysis, which concluded that because of limited evidence no definitive statements could be made about the effectiveness of assessment of biomarkers as an aid for smoking cessation. None of the primary studies included in the Cochrane review had used \"lung age\" in the intervention. The negative conclusions of that review should be updated in the light of this new study.\nThe debate about the usefulness of screening with spirometry was recently rekindled by a large nonrandomised observational study of 4494 smokers from Poland. Their results indicated that spirometry promoted cessation. Those with airways obstruction were more likely to quit, but even the group with normal lungs on spirometry had a higher quit rate (12%) than would normally be expected after simple advice from a physician (4-6%). 13 They did not use \"lung age\" to explain results to participants but did use a visual display of Fletcher and Peto's diagram to compare the participant's result with the average forage and project the likely deterioration with continued smoking. These authors did not have a control group but attributed the high quit rates in those with normal lung function to a \"healthy volunteer\" effect (those who had opted for the programme were seen as more motivated to quit).\nThe results of our study are broadly consistent with the findings of the Polish observational study, with one important difference. Contrary to the conclusions of the latter (and to clinical speculation), we found no evidence that successful quitting depends on the severity of lung damage as demonstrated by spirometry. Our study, however, was not powered to detect this difference, and we found, for example, that a 45 year\n",

      "value": "What triggers the decision to quit and which methods result in successful and sustained quitting? Clinical experience suggests that deterioration in health does not necessarily lead to altered behaviour, whether that is related to smoking, drugs, or diet. The high rate of comorbidity (20%) in our participants confirms that many people who are likely to exacerbate a chronic health problem by smoking continue to smoke. Anecdotally, some participants in our trial were relieved when the results were found to be normal and therefore thought it was \"not too late\" to be trying to quit. This apparent win-win situation might explain the apparently paradoxical finding that knowing one's lung age helps a smoker to quit whatever the result. If lung age is normal there is an incentive to stop before it is too late. If lung age is abnormal then this is a clear message that the lungs are undergoing accelerated deterioration that would be slowed if the smoker stopped. Further research is needed to elucidate the psychological forces that are active in successful quitting in different circumstances.\nIn this study, we measured stage of change (using Prochaska and DiClemente's transtheoretical model to ensure that the groups were comparable for this variable at baseline, but the study was underpowered to test the hypothesis that a smoker in the \"active\" phase of quitting would find feedback on lung age more useful than someone in the \"pre-contemplative\" phase. Some addiction experts have proposed that the transtheoretical model should be rejected in favour of anew integrated model. Any new psychological theory of smoking cessation will need to explain the unexpected finding that normal results within personal biomarkers are as likely to promote cessation as abnormal ones.\nCurrent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines include one on brief interventions and referral for smoking cessation 17 18 (which do not mention spirometry testing at all) and another on the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The implication is that spirometry testing is useful only when the patient has (or is suspected of having) established lung damage. Our results suggest that both these guidelines should be reviewed and that lung age testing (which is a quick, office based test that can be undertaken by a healthcare assistant) should be considered as part of a brief intervention packageeither in all smokers over 35 (the lower age limit for this study) or all smokers. Currently the new contract for general practitioners in the UK includes incentives to confirm the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with spirometry and to record smoking status in those with a record of relevant comorbidity (coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and asthma) and to give cessation advice. There is no incentive, however, to actively find cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among smokers (or exsmokers) in these high risk groups or in the general population. We recommend that the new UK NHS general practitioner contract should include incentives for spirometric assessment accompanied by individualised communication of lung age in smokers.\nOur cost estimates, which assume that spirometry is carried out in UK general practice, suggest that estimation and communication of lung age is of comparable effectiveness to, and potentially cheaper than, other currently available treatments on the NHS, including nicotine replacement therapy, 1 9 bupropion, 20 face to face counselling, and telephone counselling.
