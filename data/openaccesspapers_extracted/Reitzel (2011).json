      "value": "Background: The current study evaluated the efficacy of an individualized, hand-held computer-delivered treatment (CDT) versus standard treatment (ST) for the maintenance of smoking abstinence following a quit attempt. Methods: Participants were 303 adult daily smokers randomized to CDT or ST, plus pharmacotherapy. Abstinence though 1 year was examined using logistic random intercept models, a type of generalized linear mixed model regression. Results: Results did not support the efficacy of the CDT program through 1 year postquit in analyses adjusted for time and study site (OR ¼ 0.84, 95% CI ¼ 0.55-1.30), or after further adjusting for race/ethnicity, age, gender, education, marital status, and the number of cigarettes smoked per day before quitting (OR ¼ 0.89, 95% CI ¼ 0.57-1.39). Conclusions: CDT did not increase short-or long-term abstinence rates over ST in this study. Impact: Findings differ from some in the literature and suggest the need for continued research on the use of CDT for smoking cessation. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 20(7); 1555-7. Ó2011 AACR.",

      "value": "Smoking is the most preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality in the United States (1) and the health benefits of quitting are substantial. Unfortunately, of the 34% of adult smokers who make a serious quit attempt each year, only 7.5% are successful. One promising approach to increasing cessation rates maybe the use of computer-delivered treatment (CDT) provided via a small, mobile computer or smartphone. CDT might be particularly efficacious because it could be individualized on the basis of smoking preferences and empirical data, and would allow the provision of treatment in-the-moment when high-risk situations arose. The current study examined the efficacy of an individualized CDT program for smoking cessation used as an adjuvant to a standard treatment (ST). We hypothesized that CDT would increase abstinence rates through 1 year postquit relative to ST.\n",

Contrary to expectations, CDT was not more efficacious for smoking cessation than ST in this trial. Several possible explanations must be considered. It is possible that the intervention delivery device, format, or content was not appealing to participants. It is important to note that hand-held computers were not common at the time and were unfamiliar to most. Exposure to the pretreatment assessment required to individualize treatment may have diminished group differences, as may have use of NRT. In addition, the intervention may not have been intensive enough. While we report null findings, CDTs that are integrated with more commonly used and carried electronic devices (e.g., smartphones), that offer greater treatment personalization or are used for longer duration, maybe more effective.\n",
