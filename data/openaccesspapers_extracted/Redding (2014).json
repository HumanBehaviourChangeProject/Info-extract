      "value": "Smoking and sexual risk behaviors in urban adolescent females are prevalent and problematic. Family planning clinics reach those who are at most risk. This randomized effectiveness trial evaluated a transtheoretical model (TTM)-tailored intervention to increase condom use and decrease smoking. At baseline, a total of 828 14-to 17-year-old females were recruited and randomized within four urban family planning clinics. Participants received TTM or standard care (SC) computerized feedback and stage-targeted or SC counseling at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months. Blinded follow-up telephone surveys were conducted at 12 and 18 months. Analyses revealed significantly more consistent condom use in the TTM compared with the SC group at 6 and 12, but not at 18 months. In baseline consistent condom users (40%), significantly less relapse was found in the TTM compared with the SC group at 6 and 12, but not at 18 months. No significant effects for smoking prevention or cessation were found, although cessation rates matched those found previously. This TTM-tailored intervention demonstrated effectiveness for increasing consistent condom use at 6 and 12 months, but not at 18 months, in urban adolescent females. This intervention, if replicated, could be disseminated to promote consistent condom use and additional health behaviors in youth at risk.",

      "value": "The public health community has been working toward more effective ways to reach, engage and intervene with youth, especially urban, minority, economically disadvantaged adolescents. Sexual risk behaviors are prevalent among urban youth and are partially reflected in disproportionately high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy among black adolescents. Smoking is also more prevalent in urban youth, but is paradoxically, less prevalent in black youth than their counterparts. Unfortunately, black adult smoking rates are high, reaching or exceeding those of their counterparts, and smoking is associated with more severe health problems in blacks. Sexual and smoking behaviors are both associated with cervical cancer, in addition to other serious health problems. Although cervical cancer prevention efforts are now focused on HPV vaccination, uneven vaccine uptake remains problematic. Still, behavioral smoking reduction and condom promotion interventions in at risk youth are sorely needed. In contrast to vaccines which are highly specific, behavioral interventions can affect a wider range of important health outcomes. Interventions that target multiple risk behaviors may offer some synergy to maximize public health impacts. Effective, disseminable multiple behavior interventions can make important contributions toward broader public health efforts.\nThis randomized effectiveness trial of a transtheoretical model (TTM) tailored intervention package to increase condom use and decrease smoking concurrently was compared with standard care (SC) education and advice in four publicly funded family planning clinics in urban Philadelphia. Such clinics are often the primary healthcare contact for urban teenagers, reaching some teens who may not attend school. Clinics area setting that can reach teens who are both sexually active and potentially at-risk for additional health concerns. TTM interventions are especially appropriate for clinical settings, where clients maybe at all stages of change. TTM-tailored feedback was delivered using an interactive, multimedia computer-delivered expert system that was adapted from effective adult printed TTM-tailored smoking feedback. Stage-targeted counseling was adapted based on another HIV prevention counseling protocol. Multimedia interactive computer feedback can be more immediate, novel, accessible and interesting than printed feedback, engaging teens more effectively compared with print media. This system also incorporated culturally targeted pictures, background music, brief movies and voice feedback through earphones, which enhanced our ability to reach and interact with all youth, those with lower literacy levels. The computerized assessment and feedback delivery for both groups were confidential, potentially reducing response biases, especially for sensitive topics such as sexual behavior. The program provided all assessment and intervention components, collecting and storing data and delivering individually tailored interventions with high fidelity. In addition to contraceptive and clinical services, SC in family planning settings includes contraceptive and sexual health counseling, but not smoking prevention or cessation counseling.\nTTM-tailored expert system feedback TTM-tailored feedback integrates both theoretical and empirical decision rules for feedback on stages of condom use and stages of smoking cessation (for smokers) or stages of smoking acquisition (for non-smokers). Such tailored interventions can reach and communicate with those at all stages of readiness, providing positive feedback on those constructs that show sufficient effort and corrective feedback on those reflecting that more effort is needed, as well as reflecting important changes overtime (see below).\nAmong adults, a series of three printed TTMtailored reports demonstrated efficacy for smoking cessation and other health behaviors, including simultaneous multiple health behaviors. One large adolescent study demonstrated efficacy for TTM-tailored printed feedback for smoking cessation, but not prevention. This project adapted and translated an effective adult TTM-tailored print smoking cessation program to anew setting-family planning clinics, anew delivery channel-computerized multimedia, anew behavior-condom use, and anew population-urban adolescent females. A series of adaptations were made to the adult printed TTM-tailored feedback: reducing the reading level to sixth grade and the amount of tailored feedback presented onscreen; revising and testing the smoking measures used for tailoring in these adolescents; developing new measures for these adolescents for condom use feedback; writing new tailored condom use feedback; adding culturally relevant multimedia content (background pictures-see Figs 1 and 2), voice recordings, brief stage-targeted movies, including voice recording all potential feedback paragraphs for audio presentation via earphones, and conducting feasibility testing prior to launch (see below).\n",

Internal Review Boards at both the University of Rhode Island and the Family Planning Council approved all procedures and surveys for human subjects concerns. A Certificate of Confidentiality was obtained for this project to maximize legal protections. Informed assent was obtained from all participants. Participants were treated as emancipated minors, given their right to confidential family planning services. Parental consent was not required, since the risks of participation were minimal and requiring parental consent would have undermined the confidentiality of their clinic visit. Eligible participants were instructed in the use of the privately located computer with headphones. At baseline, each teen was asked to provide optimal contact times and phone numbers, to facilitate private follow-up contact. Participants were instructed to create unique usernames and passwords for the computer and could navigate using only a mouse to click on responses. The computer randomized participants to either the TTM or SC group (1:1 ratio) within each recruitment site stratified by baseline stage of condom use. Participants completed the modular condom and smoking programs in 20-30 min and reports for both the participant and her counselor were printed. Based on group assignment, participants took their printed reports to either a SC or TTM counselor. Following counseling, standard family planning medical care was provided to all participants in this study. During the 9-month intervention phase, participants could return to the clinic every 3 months fora total of four possible sessions that included both the group-specific computer-delivered feedback and in-person counseling.

Each section of expert system feedback was tailored to the participant's own stage of readiness to use condoms consistently or stage of change for smoking acquisition (among nonsmokers) or smoking cessation (among smokers). This intervention was designed to accelerate stage progress among those in early stages of change or to prevent relapse among those further along, as well as to facilitate effective recycling through the stages if participants relapsed. The program calculated scale scores associated with each key TTM construct for each stage of change, such as the pros and cons, the use of processes and situational confidence (for condom use) or temptations (to smoke or to try smoking). These scores were based on pilot data and used to generate immediate feedback onscreen and to print copies of both the report for the participant and a report for her counselor at the end of the computer session. At baseline, only current responses could be used for feedback with more than 200 unique feedback paragraphs across stages and sections. At follow-up, however, changeover time was also reflected in each section expanding the number of unique feedback paragraphs exponentially. In these ways, each participant got highly individualized and personalized feedback. Expert system feedback was presented in five sections: stage of change, pros and cons, situational selfefficacy or temptations, information about the over-use or under-use of the key processes of change appropriate for that person's stage of change and finally, supportive tips and strategies to facilitate progress. The feedback employed general terms (e.g. substitute or instead of), rather than scientific labels (e.g. counterconditioning).\n",

One common practice is to impute the last observed value to replace subsequent missing values. This 'last observation carried forward (LOCF)' approach is generally regarded as conservative and is popular among researchers. Using the LOCF approach produced the same pattern of results.

A comparable pattern of results was found with the ITT analysis (data not shown). Finally, this analysis was again conducted using a newer, recommended procedure for handling missing data, multiple imputation. The multiple imputation analysis also produced a comparable pattern of results: significant group by time interactions at 6 months and 12 months, but not at 18 months (data not shown).

This adds to the evidence base supporting individually TTM-tailored interventions for sexual health promotion. However, no smoking prevention results were found and smoking cessation outcomes, although comparable to prior studies, were not significant.\nThese data support efforts to reach and intervene with at-risk urban teenage females in family planning clinic settings, where 75% of eligible adolescents agreed to participate. The pattern of condom use outcomes in the TTM-tailored group increased from baseline to 6 months and was sustained from 6 months to 18 months, with moderate-to-large effect sizes. Some might expect outcome rates to decrease overtime after the last intervention, which would have been evident between 12 and 18 months here. Other TTM-tailored studies with adults and adolescents have also demonstrated sustained effects after the end of treatment. No 18-month group differences were found, in part due to the combined effects of increasing condom use overtime in the SC group and study attrition. Maturation, experience and/or delayed effectiveness of the SC intervention may also partially explain the increase in condom use overtime in the SC comparison group. Future process-to-outcome evaluation will be needed to shed light on these hypotheses. Getting adolescents to use condoms consistently earlier and maintain condom use longer should protect them better from unwanted pregnancy and STI outcomes.\nAlthough we did not replicate previous adolescent smoking cessation findings for the TTMtailored system, this was partially due to insufficient power. Baseline smoking rates were 20% which was more than twice the national smoking rates reported among comparable black 10th-12th graders. Power analyses found that N Â¼ 300 baseline smokers would have been necessary to find projected group differences statistically significant. Although our smoking effect size estimates included zero, they also included quit rates consistent with previous adult and adolescent studies with mostly white populations. Although quit rates were not statistically significant in this study, they still add to the metaanalytic literature on this topic. The minimally TTM-tailored smoking prevention program did not reduce smoking initiation among non-smokers, which replicates previous null findings in other adolescent samples. Alternative approaches to the difficult challenges presented by youth smoking prevention are clearly needed, perhaps including physical activity which has shown some effect on smoking prevention.\nSome might expect that adolescents coming into family planning settings would already be prepared to use condoms consistently. However, we found that all stages of condom use were represented at baseline, with only $40% reporting consistent condom use and the remaining 60% not using condoms consistently and in varying stages of readiness to start doing so. Importantly, even those who reported consistent condom use at baseline benefited from this TTM-tailored intervention and maintained their condom use better overtime, relapsing significantly less often than their peers randomized to the SC group (see). If replicated, this would support utilizing a TTM-tailored approach with the entire population of sexually active young women. All stages of change were evident among these sexually at risk, mostly black teens, who remain a priority group for sexual health promotion.
