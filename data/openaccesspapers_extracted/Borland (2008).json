      "value": "In-practice management versus quitline referral for enhancing smoking cessation in general practice: a cluster randomized trial.Family Practice 2008; 25: 382-389. Background and objective. GPs are an important source of smoking cessation advice. This research examined whether a model encouraging GP referral of patients who smoke to a specialist service would be acceptable and effective for increased smoking cessation when compared with a model of in-practice management. Methods. The study design was cluster randomized controlled trial. Practices were randomized to one of two interventions, at a rate of 1:2: (i) standard in-practice GP management or (ii) referral to a quitline service. The main outcome measures were sustained abstinence of >1 month duration at 3-month follow-up and >10 months duration at 12 months, using intention to treat analysis. Results. At 3-month follow-up, patients in the referral condition were twice as likely to report sustained abstinence than those in the in-practice condition [12.3% compared with 6.9%; odds ratio (OR) = 1.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-3.13]. At 12-month follow-up, patients in the referral condition had nearly three times the odds of sustained abstinence [6.5% compared with 2.6%; OR = 2.86 (95% CI 0.94-8.71)]. The intervention effect was mediated by the amount of help received outside the practice. Conclusions. This research provided evidence that GPs referring smokers to an evidence-based quitline service results in increased cessation. The benefit is largely due to patients in the referral condition receiving more external help than patients in the in-practice condition, as they received equivalent practice-based help. Where suitable services exist, we recommend that referral become the normative strategy for management of smoking cessation in general practice to complement any practice-based help provided.",

      "value": "GPs have a responsibility to indicate the harms associated with smoking to their patients who smoke, and where possible to encourage and support them to quit.\nBrief counselling (as little as 3 minutes duration) from a GP can substantially increase quit rates, with effectiveness increasing at higher levels of intensity. The major effect is to help motivate a quit attempt. Nonetheless, GP engagement in helping patients to quit remains limited. Systemic barriers that continue to inhibit the routine delivery of cessation counselling include perceived lack of effect, reluctance to raise the issue due to patient sensitivity about smoking, lack of time and inadequate training. In Australia, two pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation (bupropion and varenicline) are available only on prescription, but not routinely prescribed to patients who smoke. Both are eligible for reimbursement via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, meaning a complete course can be purchased for around AUD$60 (around 40 Euro).\nTo promote physician involvement, several countries, including Australia, have developed evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of tobacco dependence in general practice. An important innovation in the Australian guidelines 3 is the offer of two evidencebased strategies for providing cessation assistance: within the consultation and/or referral to specialist cessation services. In Australia, the main available service is the network of state-based quitlines that provide callback counselling and other forms of cessation support.\nGPs can either encourage their smoking patients to contact the quitline service directly or can use fax referral forms that prompt a phone call to their patients from a trained quitline advisor. For referrals, the quitline calls the smoker and discusses options for assistance, which allows callers to be directed to or offered the most appropriate form of support. Currently, it is not known whether encouraging referral (to quitline) will result in improved outcomes. In this research, we focussed on two services from the range provided by the Victorian Quitline: callback counselling and the QuitCoach, an internet-delivered, automated personalized advice programme. Both callback counselling in general and the Victorian service are demonstrably effective. Similarly, telehealth strategies can be effective, with the QuitCoach being one example. 11 These services have a number of advantages over face-to-face cessation counselling, namely convenience, accessibility and making multiple contacts easier 7 ; however, this does not guarantee that the contacts will occur. This is a study of the effectiveness of two management strategies, not a study of the effectiveness of the interventions used per se. The objectives of the study were as follows:\n(i) To investigate the relative effectiveness of inpractice GP management versus referral for increasing smoking cessation and (ii) To determine whether any benefits of one approach over the other was a function of the amount of assistance provided to the patient.\n",

GP recruitment was undertaken using a range of strategies, described in resulting in a diverse sample. Of note, 69 GP practices were initially randomized but 24 failed to recruit (13 referral, 11 inpractice). Patients who presented for any reason who were current smokers (age > 18 years), spoke English and were able to provide informed consent were eligible for recruitment. GPs, or preferably, their practice staff, were asked to recruit all eligible patients and record both refusals and failures to invite. Practices were paid $20 per recruited patient and GPs received Quality Assurance and Continuing Professional Development (QA&CPD) points for participating. Additional QA&CPD points were available if GPs concurrently audited their smoking cessation activities. Overall, 1039 smokers were recruited: 728 (70.1%) to the referral condition and 311 (29.9%) to the in-practice condition. This was less than the target sample size of 1520 from 45 GPs based on an effect size of 5% over a baseline of 5% sustained abstinence with an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.013. Difficulties in recruiting and motivating GPs, 12 resulting in increased costs, required premature termination of recruitment.\n",

Three sets of analyses were conducted: (i) using only empirically established outcomes, regardless of uptake of intervention (intention to treat); (ii) imputing 3-month outcome where possible from 12-month data; and (iii) a conservative analysis, in which all missing cases were coded as treatment failures (i.e. smokers). Reviews confirm the accuracy of self-report measures and conclude that biochemical validation of smoking status is unnecessary in trials where there is no strong association between the interviewer and respondent. Process measures. External behavioural help was defined as having received callback counselling or used the QuitCoach at least once, or attended a face-to-face cessation programme, by 3-month follow-up. In addition, we computed a measure of combined behavioural help/pharmacotherapy use (intensive assistance). Participants were coded as having received intensive assistance if they had accessed a quitline service, used pharmacotherapy, or both, in the first 3 months postrecruitment.\nData analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata, controlling for practice as a clustering variable. An alpha level of 0.05 was used for all statistical Family Practice-an international journal tests. In order to take into account the correlated nature of the data and repeated measures overtime, generalized estimating equations were used fora final analysis of outcomes. We assumed an exchangeable correlation structure. Robust (or empirical) variance was used to compute the P-values for the parameter estimates. Mediated regression analyses were also conducted to explore the possible mechanism of the treatment effect. The primary analyses used intention to treat, but we conducted subsidiary analyses using a conservative analysis of all cases with those missing outcome data assumed to be smoking.\n",

They were not precluded from recommending external assistance or indeed from referring patients to the quitline, if this was their clinical preference.\nIn the referral condition, GPs were encouraged to offer smokers with any interest in quitting referral to the Victorian Quitline. Patients who consented had their referral faxed to the quitline and were provided with a brochure on quitline services. The patient then received an introductory call from the quitline, generally within 2-3 days. Those unable to be reached by telephone were sent a brief letter notifying them of the failure and inviting them to call. When contact was made, the quitline advisor determined the patient's interest in discussing their smoking, discussed treatment options and encouraged the smoker to choose the most appropriate service for them. Decisions not to accept a service were respected.\nThe callback service offers up to two pre-quitting and four post-quitting telephone counselling sessions delivered by trained smoking cessation counsellors. Callbacks are scheduled in consultation with the client, but typically follow the relapse-sensitive schedule recommended by Zhu et al. The QuitCoach is an internet-delivered, interactive, multisession automated advice programme. Users complete a brief smoking assessment in order to obtain tailored cessation advice, and reassessments are encouraged through email prompts. It is designed to be used on multiple occasions, guiding the user through the process of smoking cessation. The QuitCoach is described in greater detail in Balmford, Borland and Benda. Both of the quitline services provided email feedback to GPs on patients' acceptance and use of services and on their quitting outcomes to facilitate ongoing patient management.\n",

The pattern of results was similar before adjusting for the covariates.\nGiven the marginal significance of the intervention on sustained cessation at 12 months, we conducted multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression to explore whether there was any evidence of a significant interaction between follow-up period and outcome.

      "value": "This research found that a system of encouraging GPs to refer smokers to an evidence-based cessation service resulted in cessation rates two to three times that of encouraging GPs to provide in-practice management. The effect was due to the smokers getting extra help to quit from outside the practice, while getting the same amount of help from within it. The benefit seems to be due to a combination of the extra help increasing both the number and success of quit attempts. The beneficial effect on quitting in the referral condition was sustained overtime. The findings add to the growing body of evidence that health professional referral of patients who smoke to evidence-based Quit services is effective and acceptable to smokers. Readers need to remember that this is atrial of two systems of help provision, not of the efficacy of either kind. The quit rates are lower in this study than among those where acceptance of the selected intervention is a prerequisite for randomization. Most of the smokers in both arms did not receive intensive cessation assistance.  Defined as having used callback service, QuitCoach or a quit course. There was some overlap; nine participants used more than one type of out-of-practice help (seven referral, two in-practice).\nBecause GPs were not compliant in keeping records on how many presenting smokers they did not recruit into the study, we are unable to be certain to what extent bias occurred. We acknowledge that because GPs carried out much of the participant recruitment, bias may have occurred in terms of their perceptions of their patients' interest in quitting. The most likely effect is that GPs in the in-practice condition would be less likely than those in the referral condition to recruit smokers low in perceived interest, as the GPs would have had less expectation that they would be able to effectively intervene. If so, the in-practice group may have been a more motivated sample, resulting in reduced capacity to find an effect. We see no other potential bias.\nConsistent with our expectations, levels of external help were higher in the referral condition than in the in-practice condition. The additional external help was mainly more cognitive-behavioural assistance, as rates of use of pharmacotherapies were similar. Higher levels of external help mediated most of the increased cessation. The effect of treatment on outcomes was mediated by the amount of help patients received beyond that provided by their GP. We thus conclude that more smokers quit in the referral than in the in-practice condition because they received more external help, while getting the same amount of practice-based help.\nActive referral of smokers to the quitline service appeared acceptable to both GPs and the majority of their patients. A higher than anticipated number of referrals to the quitline occurred, and almost three-quarters of those contacted by the quitline accepted an intensive service. It was anticipated that around one-half of all patients in the referral arm would be referred, and that half of these would accept callback counselling, inline with Victorian Quitline estimates. A notable finding was that the option of referral did not result in GPs providing less effective smoking cessation counselling within the consultation. This finding is important as it demonstrates that, at least in this case, referral was not compromising the quality of assistance provided within the practice. The sample of GPs almost certainly had a more than average interest in the issue of smoking. It was difficult recruiting GPs for this research and some of this stemmed from a reluctance to commit to extensive in-practice management. It is likely that GPs who did not participate in our research were overall less interested in providing smoking cessation assistance than those recruited. Therefore, the levels of in-practice management achieved are likely to be overestimates of what is actually occurring. Referral provides a concrete outcome to a brief motivational intervention directed at encouraging quitting. Referral to effective help should be the preferred option for general practice, except perhaps where practices are prepared to invest in systematic cessation services. In this regard, it is also likely that rates of referral we obtained are unlikely to be replicated in routine practice.\nThe callback counselling service was chosen by afar greater proportion of referred patients than the QuitCoach. It was expected that as patients referred by their GP may have been less motivated to quit than typical users of quitline services (i.e. those who proactively contact the service), they may have preferred the anonymity and lower intensity of the QuitCoach. However, in the context of an active referral by a GP, a personal service appears to be more acceptable than an automated, internet-based service. Perhaps having accepted an initial call from the quitline and becoming comfortable with the idea of talking to a counsellor about smoking cessation, any fears about the callback service were allayed. GP referral may thus bean effective means of reducing smoker reluctance to use the quitline, reasons for which include alack of understanding about what the service offers. It is also notable that the absolute size of the difference in cessation rates for the point prevalence estimates was greater than for the corresponding sustained cessation effects, suggesting that those in the referral condition were continuing to make quit attempts throughout the follow-up period. This is evidence that referral (and the accompanying assistance) did not achieve its effect by bringing quit attempts forward that would otherwise have happened, but has had a sustained effect on cessation.\nIn conclusion, this research shows that an active referral strategy results in smokers getting more assistance to quit, and as such supports the view that referral to an evidence-based cessation service should become the normative strategy for management of smoking cessation in general practice. It also shows that a telephone quitline service is an appropriate vehicle for referral. Health authorities need to develop programs to encourage GPs to refer to quitlines, and in cases where they are provided free or subsidized to smokers, ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to enable counselling for all those who want it.\nby RB, JB and NB and other authors provided input, comments and additional text on various drafts.
