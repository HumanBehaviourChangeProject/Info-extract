However, the potential benefit of telephone care above and beyond routine clinician intervention has not&nbsp;been examined previously. The objective of this study is&nbsp;to determine if telephone care increases smoking cessation compared with brief clinician intervention as part&nbsp;of routine health care.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Methods: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">This 2-group, prospective, randomized controlled trial enrolled 837 daily smokers from 5 Veterans Affairs medical centers in the upper Midwest. The telephone care group (n=417) received behavioral counseling with mailing of smoking cessation medications as clinically indicated. The standard care group (n=420) received&nbsp;intervention as part of routine health care. The primary&nbsp;outcome was self-reported 6-month duration of abstinence 12 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes&nbsp;were 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 3 and 12&nbsp;months, participation in counseling programs, and use&nbsp;of smoking cessation medications.</span></p></td>

<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Results: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Using intention-to-treat procedures, we found that the rate of 6-month abstinence at the 12-month follow-up was 13.0% in the telephone care group and 4.1%&nbsp;in the standard care group (odds ratio [OR], 3.50; 95%&nbsp;confidence interval [CI], 1.99-6.15). The rate of 7-day&nbsp;point prevalence abstinence at 3 months was 39.6% in&nbsp;the telephone care group and 10.1% in the standard care&nbsp;group (OR, 5.84; 95% CI, 4.02-8.50). Telephone care compared with standard care increased the rates of participation in counseling programs (97.1% vs 24.0%; OR,&nbsp;96.22; 95% CI, 52.57-176.11) and use of smoking cessation medications (89.6% vs 52.3%; OR, 7.85; 95% CI,&nbsp;5.34-11.53).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Understanding the possible benefits of telephone care in relation to routine health&nbsp;care provider intervention is important at&nbsp;several levels.

Performance measures of&nbsp;tobacco treatment at Veterans Affairs medical centers&nbsp;(VAMCs) show high rates of documentation of tobacco&nbsp;use status (99%) and advice to quit (75%),<sup>13</sup> and&nbsp;tobacco treatment medications are part of the national&nbsp;Veterans Affairs formulary. The objective of the present&nbsp;study was to determine if telephone care, consisting of&nbsp;counseling and provision of smoking cessation medications, increased abstinence from cigarette smoking&nbsp;compared with standard intervention as part of routine&nbsp;health care.</span></p>
<p style="background-color:#241E1E;text-align:center;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#FFFFFF;">METHODS</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">SETTING</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">This study was conducted at 5 VAMCs (Black Hills, SD; Fargo, ND; Minneapolis, Minn; Sioux Falls, SD; and St Cloud, Minn).&nbsp;All study staff were located at the Minneapolis VAMC.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">PARTICIPANTS AND RECRUITMENT</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Patients who had visited a primary care clinic at a participating VAMC in the year prior to study initiation were eligible to receive an invitation letter that included a toll-free telephone&nbsp;number at the Minneapolis VAMC. Callers were screened for&nbsp;eligibility criteria of daily smoking and willingness to set a quit&nbsp;date within the next 30 days. Individuals were excluded if they&nbsp;were not willing to receive telephone counseling, did not have&nbsp;a telephone number, were difficult to communicate with over&nbsp;the telephone (ie, had speech or hearing problems), or were&nbsp;currently using smoking cessation medications.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">RANDOMIZATION</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Participants were randomly assigned to telephone or standard care using a computer-generated randomization scheme stratified by primary care facility and blocked within sites. At the&nbsp;time of enrollment and entry into the study database, participants were permanently assigned to treatment condition as determined by the randomization sequence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">INTERVENTION</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Subjects randomized to the standard care group were mailed self-help materials (“You Can Quit Smoking” Consumer Guide<sup>14</sup>)&nbsp;and had continued access to clinical smoking cessation services through their VAMC. In addition to primary care-based&nbsp;interventions, all VAMCs have referral-based smoking cessation programs. Program structure varies by site (eg, number&nbsp;of sessions and group or individual therapy). Nicotine patches,&nbsp;nicotine gum, and slow-release bupropion hydrochloride were&nbsp;available at all sites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Subjects randomized to telephone care received counseling using a protocol adapted from the California Smokers' Helpline.<sup>15</sup> Counselors received 3 days of training. Study staff,&nbsp;including a study physician, met weekly to review participants' progress. The telephone care protocol consisted of 7 calls&nbsp;scheduled over a 2-month period in a relapse-sensitive fash-ion.<sup>15</sup> Additional courtesy calls were scheduled at the discretion of the counselor to reinforce motivation to quit or to follow up after relapse. Subjects received counseling for up to 3&nbsp;quit attempts during the 12 months after enrolling in the study.</span></p></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Telephone counselors encouraged use of pharmacologic therapy. Nicotine patch was recommended as the initial agent.&nbsp;Slow-release bupropion, nicotine gum, or a combination was recommended if the subjects had prior unsuccessful use of the nicotine patch. Medications were prescribed by study physicians&nbsp;(L.C.A. andA.M.J.). In the case of slow-release bupropion, counseling staff screened for contraindications and requested approval from the subjects' primary care providers. All medications were mailed directly to subjects from VAMC pharmacies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">OUTCOME MEASURES</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Smoking status was determined by telephone survey 3 and 12 months after study enrollment. Data collection was conducted independently of counseling by evaluation staff blinded&nbsp;to participants' intervention group. The primary outcome was&nbsp;self-reported 6-month sustained abstinence at the 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were self-reported 7-day point&nbsp;prevalent abstinence and the number of quit attempts. Process measures included the receipt of behavioral counseling and&nbsp;use of pharmacologic therapy based on telephone counseling&nbsp;records and self-report on follow-up surveys.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Recruitment occurred from June 2001 to December 2002. The intervention occurred from June 2001 to November 2003.&nbsp;The evaluation occurred from September 2001 to December&nbsp;2003. The study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards at all sites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">A likelihood ratio </span><span class="font6" style="color:#231F20;">y</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;"><sup>2</sup> test was used to compare rates of 6-month sustained abstinence and 7-day point prevalence abstinence for&nbsp;the treatment groups using intention-to-treat with nonrespondents at follow-up considered to be continuing smokers. Among&nbsp;those who completed follow-up assessments, likelihood ratio&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="color:#231F20;">y</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;"><sup>2</sup> tests were used to compare treatment groups with respect&nbsp;to the number of quit attempts and the reported use of counseling and medications.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Sample size requirements were calculated for the primary outcome. Assuming a 2-sided significance level of .05, the study&nbsp;sample size provided 80% power or greater to detect a change&nbsp;in the smoking abstinence rate of 7.5% given an abstinence rate&nbsp;in the standard care group of 14% or less.</span></p>

Seventy-two percent&nbsp;of participants (299) completed 3 or more counseling calls.&nbsp;Owing to courtesy calls, relapses, and counseling associated with repeated attempts to quit, subjects completed a mean (SD) of 7.7 (4.1) calls. The median time&nbsp;from study enrollment to participants’ last call was 77&nbsp;days (mean [SD] time, 103.3 [76.3] days). Eighty-four&nbsp;percent of subjects (352/417) completed their final call&nbsp;within 180 days of study enrollment.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Participation in smoking cessation counseling programs was substantially higher in the telephone care group than&nbsp;in the standard care group (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Table 4</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">). At 3 months, 82.4%&nbsp;of individuals in the telephone care group (313/380) and&nbsp;11.4% of individuals in the standard care group (42/368)&nbsp;reported participating in any smoking cessation counseling program (telephone, individual, or group counseling&nbsp;program; OR, 36.26; 95% CI, 23.93-54.95). A large difference persisted at the 12-month follow-up. Fewer individuals in the telephone care group used in-person individual and group counseling services. The absolute rates&nbsp;of use of in-person programs were quite low overall.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Use of smoking cessation medications was significantly higher in the telephone care group than in the standard care group. At 3 months, 86.3% of subjects in the telephone care group (327/379) and 30.1% of subjects&nbsp;in the standard care group (112/372) reported any use&nbsp;of smoking cessation medications (OR, 14.60; 95% CI,&nbsp;10.11-21.07). While a greater number of subjects in the&nbsp;standard care group began using medications more than&nbsp;3 months after study enrollment, the difference in rates&nbsp;of medication use persisted at the 12-month follow-up.</span></p></td>

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;padding:0pt 0pt 17pt 0pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Over the course of the study in the standard care group, 43% of participants (149/348) used neither a medication nor a counseling program, 33% (116/348) used 1&nbsp;or more smoking cessation medications but no counseling program, 6% (20/348) used a counseling program but&nbsp;no medications, and 18% (63/348) used both medications and a counseling program. The 6-month abstinence rates for these groups were 2.7% (4/149), 2.6% (3/&nbsp;116), 10.0% (2/20), and 12.7% (8/63), respectively. This&nbsp;compares with the telephone care group in which 88.0%&nbsp;of participants (345/392) used both medications and a&nbsp;counseling program and had a 6-month abstinence rate&nbsp;of 11.9% (41/345). These findings suggest that the overall difference in abstinence between the 2 treatment groups&nbsp;is due mainly to the greater number of participants in the&nbsp;telephone care group that used both smoking cessation&nbsp;medications and a counseling program.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Among smokers who are interested in quitting, the option of receiving services over the telephone dramatically increases the use of behavioral counseling and pharmacologic therapy. Even compared with very high rates of brief health care provider intervention in the standard care group, smokers receiving telephone care were&nbsp;more successful in achieving abstinence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">The increase in smoking cessation observed in this study is consistent with delivery of a combined behavioral and pharmacologic intervention. A recent review</span></p></td></tr></table><hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">suggests that telephone counseling alone increases the odds of quitting by 1.56 (95% CI, 1.38-1.77).<sup>12</sup> Reviews&nbsp;of pharmacologic agents commonly prescribed in this&nbsp;study suggest that they increase the odds of quitting by&nbsp;1.66 for nicotine gum (95% CI, 1.52-1.81), 1.74 for the&nbsp;nicotine patch (95% CI, 1.57-1.93), and 1.97 for slow-release bupropion (95% CI, 1.67-2.34).<sup>16,17</sup> The odds of&nbsp;smoking cessation in our telephone care group were&nbsp;higher than might be expected for either telephone counseling or pharmacologic therapy alone, and this finding&nbsp;reinforces the recommendations of the national guidelines that combined behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for tobacco use is optimal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Telephone care resulted in larger increases in sustained abstinence (of 6 months or more) than in shortterm (7-day) abstinence at 12 months. Proactive telephone counseling has been shown in prior studies to reduce relapse rates.<sup>7,9</sup> The telephone care group in the&nbsp;present study also had more immediate access to services than participants in the standard care group (who&nbsp;needed to visit or contact their health care provider to&nbsp;initiate treatment). More immediate assistance in the telephone care group may have accelerated progress toward smoking cessation compared with the standard care&nbsp;group and contributed to the finding of a greater increase in sustained abstinence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">An important lesson from this study is that large differences in provision of services are needed to produce meaningful differences in smoking cessation rates. Many&nbsp;attempts to improve delivery of tobacco treatment result in modest increases in use of services with little or&nbsp;no measurable increase in cessation.<sup>18-23</sup> This does not&nbsp;necessarily mean that smoking cessation treatments are&nbsp;not effective, but rather that the magnitude of the change&nbsp;in services delivery is often not sufficient to lead to measurable increases in cessation. These findings highlight&nbsp;the need for major structural changes in the delivery of&nbsp;tobacco treatment services such as those tested herein&nbsp;and proposed in the national action plan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">This study has several limitations. First, because there was no in-person contact between study staff and participants, it was not logistically feasible to perform biochemical validation of smoking status. Prior analyses suggest that underreporting of smoking in field trials, such&nbsp;as this one, is very low.<sup>24-27</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Another limitation is that we tested the intervention in a select population. Participants were predominantly male,&nbsp;elderly, and had multiple medical problems as well as extensive smoking histories with past unsuccessful quit attempts. The 4% abstinence rate at 6 months in the standard care group may be somewhat lower than expected&nbsp;among daily smokers in the general population.<sup>28</sup> Past unsuccessful attempts to quit despite use of pharmacologic&nbsp;therapy<sup>29,30</sup> and continued smoking despite diagnosis of&nbsp;smoking-related diseases may indicate that participants in&nbsp;this study had particularly substantial barriers to quit-ting.<sup>31</sup> Of note, the use of pharmacologic therapy (without counseling) did not seem to offer substantial benefits&nbsp;in the standard care group. The relative lack of efficacy of&nbsp;the nicotine patch in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease has been noted previously.<sup>31,32</sup> Given these&nbsp;issues, it is possible that the magnitude of the treatment&nbsp;effect of telephone care compared with standard care would&nbsp;be different in a more general population of smokers.</span></p></td>

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">Finally, the total number and duration of telephone contacts in this study was greater than has been reported in other studies of telephone counseling.<sup>6-11</sup> Given&nbsp;the dose-response relationship between the intensity of&nbsp;counseling and smoking cessation outcomes,<sup>3</sup> future studies seeking similar results would need to plan to provide a similarly intensive intervention.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">The findings of this study suggest several avenues for future research. Telephone care provided in this study&nbsp;combined increased access to behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. Because these 2 components were offered together, we are unable to identify their unique contribution to the overall benefit of the intervention. Future&nbsp;studies might compare increased access to pharmacologic therapy vs combined behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. Additional work is also needed to develop methods to integrate telephone care into existing&nbsp;health care delivery systems and compare reactive and&nbsp;proactive strategies for patient recruitment and referral&nbsp;to treatment services.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;color:#231F20;">This study shows that telephone care increases use of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments and results in&nbsp;increased smoking cessation compared with brief health&nbsp;care provider intervention as part of routine health care.&nbsp;At a minimum, telephone care for smoking cessation&nbsp;should be made available to veterans who are interested&nbsp;in stopping smoking. The findings of this study lend additional support to the recommendation for a national&nbsp;network of quitlines that would make these services available to all tobacco users in this country.</span></p>
