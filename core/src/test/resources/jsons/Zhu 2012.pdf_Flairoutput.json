Some of this work has successfully transitioned from research to practice. The most notable case is probably smoking cessation counseling (4). In 1992, California established the first statewide telephone counseling service for smoking cessation, using a protocol tested in a large randomized trial (5). The service came to be known by the term \u201cquitline.\u201d By 2004, every state in the United States had its own quitline. The public health guidelines recommended these quitlines (6) and state health departments supported them (7). Currently, these 50 state quitlines collectively serve nearly 500 000 tobacco users each year (8). For many states, quitlines have become an integral part of their tobacco control programs, regularly promoted as part of state-run antismoking media campaigns (9-12)."},{"entities":[{"confidence":0.8311853408813477,"end_pos":126,"start_pos":113,"text":"United States","type":"Country_of_intervention"}],"labels":[],"text":"The enthusiasm, however, is much lower when it comes to promoting quitlines among Asian language speakers in the United States (13-15). There are many reasons for this. One is the prevailing belief that the Asian immigrant population tends to take care of itself, and smokers in that group will not call a quitline to ask for help (16-20). A recent study, nevertheless, has shown that this is not the case if the quitline is promoted through Asian language media channels (21). Another reason is the perceived lack of evidence of the telephone-based quitline service\u2019s efficacy for Asian populations (15). Although meta-analyses (1,22) have shown the general efficacy of telephone counseling for smoking cessation, there continues to be doubt about its efficacy for Asian populations. The reasoning is that \u201ctalk therapy\u201d is not a familiar concept to recent immigrants from Asian countries, whose culture generally does not consider outside professional help as a way to solve behavioral health problems (18,19,23).

First, it was assumed that the process involved in changing smoking behavior was the same for all smokers, whether they speak English or an Asian language.

Third, despite cultural differences among Asian language speakers, it was assumed that a separate counseling protocol was not necessary for each Asian language group. Instead, a single protocol could be developed for all Asian language groups. Moreover, the protocol would be structured, providing the minimum acceptable content for each counseling session. It would serve as a guide for the flow of each counseling session and remind the counselor to attend to important issues most relevant at different points in the quitting process (G. J.
