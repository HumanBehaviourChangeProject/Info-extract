The potential effect of adding physical activity counselling on depressive symptoms and physical activity was also explored. Participants were randomly assigned to a 12-week programme comprising an orientation and access to fitness centre resources (control, n = 18)  or that programme plus 6 physical activity counselling sessions (intervention, n = 18). Outcome measures were feasibility (fitness centre attendance over 12 weeks); Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) completed at baseline and week 12; and qualitative programme feedback. Fitness centre attendance averaged only 12 days (14% of all possible days) with no differences between study groups. No group differences were found on IPAQ or BDI-II scores at week 12. Increases from baseline in IPAQ moderate/vigorous activity minutes were associated with decreases in BDI-II scores at week 12 (p < 0.001). The most helpful programme aspect reported was connecting participants to fitness centre resources. In this pilot study of depressed outpatients, an unsupervised fitness centre based program was not feasible for promoting exercise adherence and adding physical activity counselling was not useful for increasing physical activity levels or reducing depression.",

      "value": "Depressed adults are less physically active and have lower fitness levels than the general population. Exercise is an evidence-based treatment for depression with exercise effects comparable to cognitive behavioural therapy or antidepressant medication. Proposed mechanisms accounting for exercise response among depressed individuals include neurobiological adaptations and increases in self-efficacy. Emerging evidence indicates that exercise interventions may have added mood benefits among patients receiving concurrent antidepressant therapy or medication non-responders.\nA 2016 meta-analysis evaluated exercise as a treatment for depression among mostly outpatient populations. A total of 25 trials (involving 1487 participants) were included; 9 trials included patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) while 14 included patients with elevated depressive symptoms. The majority (72%, 18/25) of studies used supervised, facility-based exercise, 3 included unsupervised (home-based) programmes, and 2 utilized both formats. Overall, both supervised and unsupervised formats were effective for reducing depression. However, among patients with MDD, larger effects were found for interventions supervised by exercise professionals. In the United Kingdom, supervised exercise programmes, thrice weekly, over 10-14 weeks, are recommended as a treatment option for people with depression (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2016). However, supervised programmes reduce intervention scalability. From the literature, it is also not clear how much support, supervision, and structure is needed among patients with MDD for enhancing adherence to exercise and depressive symptom reduction. Only one study compared home-based and supervised facility-based exercise programmes with no differences found on depressive symptom reduction. Therefore, additional research on different delivery formats for exercise programmes among patients with MDD is warranted.\nThis pilot study evaluated the feasibility for promoting exercise adherence of an unsupervised, facility-based, exercise programme consisting of an orientation and access to fitness centre resources among outpatients with MDD. In addition, we explored the potential effect of adding physical activity counselling to the exercise programme on physical activity levels and depressive symptoms, using a pilot, two-group, randomized, controlled study design.\n",

If a participant had a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter/defibrillator, body composition was assessed using via skin callipers, as opposed to bioelectrical impedance.\nThe individually-tailored exercise prescription included aerobic exercise, strength training, stretching, and recommendations to exercise regularly. The exercise prescription was based on the cardio-respiratory fitness test and the ACSM (ACSM, 2014) guidelines recommending 30 minutes or more of moderate-vigorous intensity exercise on at least 5 days per week. Participants were invited to ask questions of the fitness centre staff at anytime. Exercise at the fitness centre and at home were both encouraged but no supervised exercise was provided.

Participants were also asked to email their counsellor onetime per week to check in regarding exercise. The counsellor responded with reinforcement and adherence encouragement. The counsellor contacted participants if they missed a session and rescheduled the session that same week or conducted a make-up telephone session.\nThe exercise counsellor had a background in health education and substantial experience delivering exercise interventions as part of a research protocol. The counsellor received training on the intervention protocol and monitored delivery of intervention components using a checklist. Sessions were audiotaped and a random sample of 10% of early, middle, and late sessions was evaluated based on a checklist.

The programme is not feasible based on low attendance at the fitness centre and no significant change from baseline on physical activity levels at the end of treatment. Our results are consistent with another study that found advice and encouragement to increase physical activity was not sufficient for reducing symptoms of depression.\nWhile depressive symptom reductions were observed overall, significant differences were not detected between study groups. One potential explanation is the small sample size limited our ability to detect statistically significant differences between groups. Moreover, most patients were receiving anti-depressant medication therapy which may have masked any potential benefits of physical activity on depression response. Most likely however is that the exercise programme and physical activity counselling may not have been sufficiently intense to impact depressive symptoms or physical activity. At the end of treatment, only about one-third of the intervention participants met the recommended guidelines for exercise of ≥ 150 minutes of moderate/vigorous intensity exercise per week. However, there appeared to be some overall benefit of the programme for positive movement in stage of change for exercise. We observed that overall increases in minutes of moderate/vigorous activity were significantly associated with decreases in depression. These findings, along with other reports suggest efforts are needed to increase exercise to a therapeutic dose among depressed patients.\nAs with all pilot trials, our findings are limited by the small sample size. Moreover, some characteristics of the sample limit generalizability of the findings. Mostly women, White, educated adults enrolled. Future studies are needed to test exercise programme strategies in diverse populations with MDD. A second limitation is that we used an additive design with active control condition, and future studies would benefit from a delayed treatment control condition or one that equates study groups for contact time. Third, the data obtained from the fitness centre was limited to total number of sessions attended whereas information collected on a weekly basis would have been more informative and linked to the exercise prescription. Fourth, the follow-up occurred a year after study enrolment and some participants may have forgotten some positive or negative aspects of the study. Ideally, the follow-up would have been done more proximal to the programme end.\nDespite these limitations, our results point to the need for novel approaches to providing supervised exercise programmes for patients with MDD. Qualitative programme feedback from participants indicated the most helpful aspects of participation were the structured aspects of the exercise programme such as connecting them to the resources available at a worksite fitness centre; and for intervention participants, the support and understanding from an exercise counsellor, someone to be accountable to and individualized time. However, supervised facility-based programmes reduce intervention reach and increase costs. A potential innovation to scale up supervised exercise programmes is using technology such as digital coaching or a robotic telepresence.\n",
