      "value": "Objectives: Our purpose was to determine long-term maintenance of physical activity (PA) following the 48-week Women's Lifestyle PA program, targeted/tailored for African-American women. Methods: The parent study consisted of a 3-arm randomized clinical trial with 3 assessment points: baseline (pre-intervention); 24 weeks post-baseline (end active intervention); and 48 weeks postbaseline (end maintenance intervention). Present analyses supplement the original results by adding a long-term maintenance assessment that occurred 2 to 4 years post-baseline. Participants were 288 African-American women aged 40 to 65 without major signs/symptoms of pulmonary/cardiovascular disease. The active intervention included 5 group meetings, with 9 personal motivational calls, 9 automated motivational calls, or no calls between meetings. The mainte-nance intervention included one group meeting and either 2 calls or no calls. PA was assessed with the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors. Results: Retention was 90%. Over long-term maintenance, there was a decline in PA, but levels remained significantly higher than baseline for moderate/vigorous PA (p < .001), leisure moderate/vigorous PA (p < .001) and walking (p = .006). Variations by condition/ site were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that long-term maintenance of PA increases resulting from group meetings in an active intervention occur when followed by a maintenance intervention.",

      "value": "C ompared to their white counterparts, African-American women have higher levels of hypertension (42.9% vs 27.7%), cardiovascular disease (48.3% vs 31.9%), diabetes (14.6% vs 6.1%), and obesity (57.5% vs 32.5%). Furthermore, only 37.5% of African-American wom-en compared to 51.4% of white American women meet 2008 National Physical Activity Guidelines; thus, most African-American women are not receiving the health and cardio-protective benefits of regular, moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). To address these disparities, there is a critical need for physical activity interventions for African-American women, particularly during the menopausal transition with its related increases in systolic blood pressure and tendency for central obesity. A policy statement related to women's heart health called for implementing interventions effective in creating lifelong sustained healthful habits. It is important not only to encourage and initiate regular physical activity in African-American women, but also to ensure that they maintain the behavior. An early review paper revealed that few studies had examined maintenance of physical activity more than 6 months beyond cessation of the active intervention. Those authors concluded that the use of maintenance interventions, such as frequent contact following the active intervention, was important in maintaining change in physical activity. They also recommended conducting follow-up studies of persons who previously participated in physical activity trials.\nIn 2003, the Health Maintenance Consortium, coordinated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, was established to develop the science of maintaining healthy behaviors, including identifying the proper lexicon or definitions of maintenance. This group defined maintenance as continued behavior fora defined period of time after an intervention. The Health Maintenance Consortium also made a distinction between maintenance intervention studies that tested strategies for enhancing maintenance of physical activity following the active intervention and long-term studies that looked at maintenance without a maintenance intervention. A systematic review identified 15 studies that examined maintenance of behavior change following an active physical activity intervention. The duration of the active interventions ranged from 1 day to 12 months, and the length of maintenance ranged from 3 months to 24 months (M = 8.3 months) after completion of the active intervention. Differences were reported in physical activity from baseline to the last assessment. Six studies had a maintenance intervention; 10-15 9 studies followed maintenance of physical activity after only an active intervention. Most studies showed improvements in at least one physical activity outcome at the end of the active intervention; of these, 9 maintained improvements following the active intervention. Of the studies with a maintenance intervention component, 83% (5/6) showed improvement in physical activity. Only 44% (4/9) of the long-term maintenance studies showed similar improvement, suggesting that a maintenance intervention is more beneficial immediately following the active intervention. None of the maintenance intervention studies, however, looked at sustained physical activity following the maintenance intervention. In addition, the focus of most studies (10/15) was on weight loss or physical activity in persons with a health problem such as diabetes, arthritis, cancer, or cardiovascular disease. Only 4 studies included African Americans, but they represented less than one-third of the participants in these 4 studies, and the studies did not focus on healthy middle-aged participants.\nExamination of 13 community-based physical activity intervention studies developed for and delivered primarily to African-American women (10/13 had samples of 100% women; the other 3 had samples of > 75% women) revealed 4 stud-ies that looked at maintenance of physical activity after cessation of the active intervention; 2 of those studies had maintenance interventions delivered following the active intervention, whereas 2 followed the long-term history of maintenance. All 4 studies showed improvements in physical activity at the end of the active intervention, but only one study found that improvements were maintained following the end of the active intervention. The purpose of these analyses was to examine African-American women's long-term maintenance of physical activity following the end of the 48-week Women's Lifestyle Physical Activity program. The program included 3 different treatment conditions (group meetings plus personal telephone calls, group meetings plus automated telephone phone calls, group meetings alone) with a 24-week active intervention period followed by a less intensive 24-week maintenance intervention period. The aims were to determine: (1) midlife African-American women's long-term history of maintenance of physical activity following the Women's Lifestyle Physical Activity program; and (2) differences in the long-term maintenance of physical activity by treatment condition.\n",

      "value": "Full details of the randomized clinical trial (RCT) design from the parent study are available elsewhere. Briefly, the order of delivery of the 3 intervention conditions to increase physical activity was randomly assigned and counterbalanced across 6 community intervention sites using a Latin-square design. Six sites were selected because doing so allowed us to have completely counterbalanced ordering of the 3 conditions. The study statistician used a random number-generating function from Excel to create a site assignment worksheet for the study. Each site received anew condition after the prior condition finished. This was done to minimize site and order effects across the 3 study conditions. Over 3 waves, each of the 3 intervention conditions were delivered at each of the 6 study sites fora total of 18 groups (Figure). The start time for the intervention condition was staggered by 4 weeks across the 6 sites in waves. Once a group at each site completed the 48-week intervention, anew group began the next randomly assigned condition at that site.\nFor these supplementary analyses, assessment of long-term maintenance began one year after the final wave of the first site completed the intervention. Long-term maintenance assessments were staggered by 4 weeks and completed for each site (all 3 waves simultaneously) in the order in which the sites began the intervention condition. Thus, assessment of long-term maintenance varied by when the woman completed the intervention. Most women participated in long-term maintenance assessment one to 3 years after completing the intervention. Therefore, these analyses included data collected at 4 time points: baseline (pre-intervention); 24 weeks post-baseline (end of active intervention); 48 weeks post-baseline (end of maintenance intervention); and 2 to 4 years post-baseline (long-term maintenance).\nRecruitment for the parent study occurred from February 2010 to October 2012. The last intervention group ended October 2013. Long-term maintenance assessment began in February 2014 and ended in November 2014. Data collectors throughout were blinded to the study condition.\n",

      "value": "Described in detail earlier, the Women's Lifestyle Physical Activity program included a 24-week active intervention period followed by a 24-week maintenance intervention period (total 48 weeks). The intensive active intervention period for all conditions was set at 24 weeks to be consistent with the body of physical activity intervention studies that broadly suggests that adoption of a behavior change occurs over 6 months. There is evidence showing that interventions achieving sustained long-term change following the end of the intervention may need to be longer than 24 weeks. Therefore, the 24-week active intervention period was followed by the addition of a less intensive 24week maintenance intervention period.\nThe program had a core component and tested 3 intervention conditions: (1) a person-administered telephone contact (PC); (2) an automated telephone contact (AC); and (3) no telephone contact as the control condition. The core, delivered in all conditions, included a physical activity prescription and 6 group meetings held at the community healthcare site. The physical activity prescription was tailored to the individual woman with a goal to increase the eventual number of steps walked to 3000 steps over her baseline steps. Baseline steps were from a blinded pedometer worn fora week prior to the first group meeting. Each woman received an accelerometer and entered her steps weekly into an automated telephone computer linked system.\nGroup meetings of 13 to 18 women were held which also allowed for individual time with the interventionist for reviewing physical activity steps from the automated telephone computer linked system and updating physical activity goals with an interventionist. Group time was spent emphasizing self-management. Social Cognitive Theory concepts and strategies were applied systematically in group meetings, including vicarious expe-rience, behavioral capability, behavioral rehearsal, self-regulation, and reciprocal determinism. The first 5 group meetings were delivered every 5 weeks during the 24 weeks of active intervention (weeks 1-24) and one booster group visit was delivered during the 24 weeks of maintenance intervention (weeks . Discussion in group meetings held during the active intervention focused on increasing lifestyle physical activity (bodily movement generated by muscle contraction that increases energy expenditure and can be obtained during one's daily routine), dealing with personal and environmental problems that can interfere with physical activity, and handling relapses to a more sedentary lifestyle. At the booster session women shared experiences since their last group visit and their techniques to solve problems.\nThe 2 telephone contact approaches were tailored to the individual and intended to sustain effects between group meetings. Motivational interviewing, a counseling style that elicits behavior change by helping participants explore and resolve ambivalence, was used for the PC condition. The AC condition had an automated telephone computerlinked system that could contact participants allowing them to select from a menu of motivational messages to overcome their own perceived barriers to physical activity. The PC and AC conditions both had 11 calls delivered at the same time intervals between group meetings. Nine calls occurred during the 24-week active intervention period, and 2 calls occurred during the 24-week maintenance intervention period. At the end of the intervention women were given their own pedometer and encouraged to continue to self-monitor their physical activity into long-term maintenance.\n",

Women were given the option to have the questionnaires read to them at all of these assessment points. At long-term follow-up, women mailed the questionnaire back in an enclosed, stamped envelope or were given the option to answer the questions over the phone.\nBaseline characteristics. Demographics included age, marital status, number of children, education, and income. Material hardship was measured using questions from the US Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation about food adequacy and ability to meet housing, utility, telephone, and medical expenses.\nHealth status measures included general health and stress. The 14-item global Perceived Stress Scale was used to measure the degree to which situations in the participant's life were perceived as stressful. Women were asked how often during the past month they experienced specific feelings and thoughts on a scale from 0 = never to 4 = very often. Items are summed fora total of 0 to 56, with a higher score indicating higher stress. In-ternal consistency was acceptable across multiple trials (αs ≥ .78). Correlation with other measures with established validity demonstrated construct validity. The measure of general health was one item from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System that asked participants about their overall health status from 5 = excellent to 1 = poor. Neighborhood walkability was measured by the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS), 52 a 28-item self-report measure, based on respondents' perceptions of neighborhood characteristics perceived to be conducive to walking (eg, surroundings, safety, access to services, and side-walk infrastructure). A Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree) is used. The overall score is the mean item score. The higher score, the better the perceived walkability. Internal consistency for this sample was α = .88.\nLifestyle physical activity. The amount of lifestyle MVPA obtained per week was measured with the 30-item Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) physical activity questionnaire. The CHAMPS was developed for use with middle-aged and older adults and adapted for African Americans. Participants are asked to estimate the frequency and average total amount of time spent weekly in the past 2 weeks doing a variety of daily activities. Each activity has an assigned metabolic equivalent (MET) value based on the 2000 Compendium of Physical Activities. Moderate physical activities have MET values 3.0 to 6.0 and vigorous have MET values > 6.0. Average minutes per week for overall MVPA, leisure MVPA, and walking are reported. Six-month test-retest reliability for moderate-intensity physical activity was 0.76. Validity for African Americans was supported by correlations (0.16-0.32) with estimated VO 2max and for older adults by a correlation of 0.28 with doubly labeled water (physical activity energy expenditure in free-living older adults).\n",

An intent-to-treat approach was taken in these analyses using multilevel modeling to estimate parameters using maximum likelihood methods and including all participants. Sample size calculation was reported earlier. Long-term maintenance of self-reported physical activity was examined using discontinuous linear growth models. In these models, assessments (baseline, 24week [end of active intervention], 48-week [end of maintenance intervention], and long-term maintenance) were repeated within participant. Time (in weeks) was calculated based on individual interview dates and was centered at the 48-week assessment. A binary variable representing the growth discontinuity was coded as zero for the first 3 assessments (intervention period, which represents a combination of the active intervention period and the maintenance intervention period) and coded as one for the fourth assessment (representing the long-term maintenance period). By including a time x discontinuity interaction effect, we were able to model change in time slope from the intervention period to the long-term maintenance period. Multilevel linear growth models included all cases using all available data for each participant. This allowed us to look at the rapid increase in physical activity over the course of the intervention, followed by an expected zero or slow decline of physical activity over long-term maintenance. Effects sizes estimates (standardized mean difference) of mean change from baseline to the end of long-term maintenance were calculated using model-based planned contrasts divided by the pooled baseline standard deviation.\n",

The discontinuous growth model for total MVPA (Table) showed a significant increase in MVPA over the intervention period (active and maintenance strategies). Weekly MVPA increased 3.74 minutes each week during the intervention period (active and maintenance strategies). During long-term maintenance, MVPA was essentially unchanged. Thus, contrary to expectations, there was no evidence of a significant decline in total MVPA. Planned contrasts revealed that women reported nearly 3 hours (M = 179 minutes; d = 0.71; p < .001) more weekly MVPA than at baseline 3 years following the maintenance intervention strategies. There was no sig- nificant variation in growth parameters by intervention condition. The discontinuous growth model for leisure MVPA showed a statistically significant increase over the intervention period. Weekly leisure MVPA increased 3.19 minutes each week during the intervention. During long-term maintenance, weekly leisure MVPA decreased 0.32 minutes each week, although this was not a statistically significant change (p = .09). Three years following the intervention maintenance strategies, women reported 103 minutes more weekly leisure MVPA than at baseline (d = 0.48; p < .001). There was no significant variation by intervention condition.\nThe discontinuous growth model for walking showed a statistically significant increase in walking over the course of the intervention period. Weekly walking increased on average 4.14 minutes each week during the intervention (Table). During long-term maintenance, weekly walking decreased on average 0.80 minutes each week (p < .001). Although the decrease was more pronounced than for total MVPA or leisure MVPA, participants aver-aged 74.4 minutes more weekly walking 3 years after the intervention compared to baseline (d = 0.37; p = .006). There was no significant variation by intervention condition. Due to significant baseline differences in age and education by completion of the long-term maintenance assessment, we tested models that included each of these baseline factors as covariates (ie, in interaction with the time and discontinuity slopes) and found neither statistically significant effects of these baseline factors nor any change in the main results for any of the outcomes.

      "value": "The most recent known review of studies that addressed maintenance of physical activity following an intervention identified only 15 studies, none of which looked at the long-term history of maintenance of physical activity following a maintenance intervention period. Also, none of the studies included healthy middle-aged African-American women. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to follow maintenance of physical activity in African-American women and to look at the natural course of long-term maintenance following a maintenance intervention.\nWe reported earlier the positive effects of the Women's Lifestyle Physical Activity Program on adherence to physical activity at the end of the active intervention period (24 weeks). Increased adherence to physical activity occurred in the 3 intervention conditions, all of which received a common core of 5 group meetings over the 24 weeks. These positive effects on physical activity adherence also were seen at 48 weeks, following 24 weeks with one maintenance booster group meeting. Longterm maintenance in the current study shows that, although overall adherence declined following one to 3 years of maintenance with no intervention, physical activity did not revert to baseline levels. Overall effect sizes averaged around 0.5 across the 3 outcomes (MVPA, leisure MVPA, walking). This effect size is similar to the median effect size for the 5 earlier studies that found positive effects of longterm maintenance (median d = .53). Time from end of the intervention to end of maintenance varied from 3 to 24 months (5 under 12 months) in those studies, whereas our follow-up ranged from 1 to 3 years. These findings suggest long-term (3year) sustained effectiveness of the Women's Lifestyle Physical Activity Program.\nBased on findings and recommendations from the most recent systematic review of physical activity maintenance studies, a number of factors in this study, such as retention and design, lend strength to the findings. A criticism of prior physical activity maintenance studies is that findings were based on samples with retention rates that could below (< 70%). Thus, the possibility of greater attrition among those who did not meet their physical activity goal may have inflated maintenance of physical activity. Retention in our study was high (90%), and we found no differences be-tween those who were retained or not retained on health status, environmental characteristics, or most demographic characteristics. The 5 earlier studies that maintained long-term improvement in physical activity following an active intervention had an average retention of 75% (range 62% to 87%). Therefore, we can say confidently that the midlife African-American women in the Women's Lifestyle Physical Activity Program were successful in maintaining physical activity above baseline for an extended period.\nThe intervention design in our study also contributed to sustaining physical activity maintenance. We used a face-to-face group intervention contact that the systematic review showed resulted in higher maintenance of physical activity compared to those that did not. Also contributing to higher physical activity maintenance was the length of the active intervention; active interventions over 24 weeks tended to have higher maintenance. However, frequency of contact during the intervention period did not influence maintenance in reported studies. Consistent with those findings, our current study used only 5 face-to-face group meeting contacts over the 24-week active intervention period, with one booster group meeting in the subsequent 24-week maintenance intervention period. Delivering group meetings over along time is more cost-effective than an intervention with more frequent contact over the same time.\nIn our study, adherence to physical activity at 48 weeks (the end of the maintenance intervention) was higher in women who attended more group meetings. Likewise, women who received a higher dose of group meetings had significantly higher physical activity adherence during longterm maintenance. The strength of the intervention was the implementation of strategies based on concepts from social cognitive theory 46 associated with maintenance. Some examples include behavioral rehearsal through role modeling, behavioral capability through instruction in accelerometer skills to self-monitor physical activity, self -regulation through identifying realistic physical activity goals, reciprocal determinism through identifying support systems and safe times and locations for physical activity, and vicarious experience through sharing experiences.\nConsistent with findings both at the end of the active intervention period (24 weeks) and the end of the maintenance intervention period (48 weeks), there were no differences in maintenance of physical activity by intervention condition at the longterm maintenance assessment. This suggests that group meetings may not only support adoption of physical activity during the active intervention and maintenance intervention periods, but also promote long-term maintenance. Also, physical activity in this intervention focused on lifestyle physical activity, which has been shown to be easier to maintain than structured group-based exercise. Despite strengths there are 2 major limitations with these analyses. First, the additional costs in terms of time of distributing and retrieving accelerometers (our objective physical activity measure) precluded their use for long-term follow-up of maintenance. Reliance was on a self-report measure of physical activity, which is highly vulnerable to recall. The Women's Lifestyle Physical Activity program focused on changing behavior; thus, participants may have been more likely to over-report how well they maintained physical activity because they knew the purpose of the study. Despite the known limitations of self-report, however, we used a self-report measure with established reliability and validity that has been used frequently in physical activity interventions with adults. Moreover, we earlier reported that adherence to physical activity increased significantly (p = .001) for self-report (d = .56, 128 minutes/week) and for accelerometer (d = .37, 830 steps/day) at 24 weeks and was maintained at 48 weeks (p = . 001). This suggests evidence of validity for the self-report measure. Future studies should use objective measures of physical activity whenever feasible. Second, the analyses were limited by a followup design that included only a single assessment of women at varying time points during long-term maintenance. This single time point occurred atone, 2, or 3 years post completion of the maintenance intervention. This limitation makes it difficult to estimate non-linear trajectories during long-term maintenance.\nThese limitations are consistent with the prior systematic review that noted that funding for intervention research often is unavailable for extended follow-up into maintenance or post-intervention. This study attempted to use an innovative design and analysis to begin to capture long-term follow-up while incurring minimal additional costs.\nIn conclusion, even with limitations, findings from this follow-up study suggest the benefits of having a 24-week active intervention period followed by a 24-week less intensive maintenance intervention period. The use of group meetings based on social cognitive theory maybe a powerful intervention for not only supporting adoption of physical activity during the intervention periods, but also promoting long-term maintenance.\n",
