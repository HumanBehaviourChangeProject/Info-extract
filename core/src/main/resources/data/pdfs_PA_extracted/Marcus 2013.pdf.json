      "value": "R egular physical activity (PA) is associated with lower morbidity and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and other chronic diseases. Yet PA rates in the U.S. are markedly low. Latinos in particular report the highest rates of inactivity (44%) and also suffer disproportionately from conditions linked to sedentary lifestyle, including diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. These disparities represent a significant public health concern and are especially pronounced among Latino women. Thus, interventions to increase PA in Latinas are especially needed.\nSeveral PA interventions have targeted Latinas by providing materials and site-based programs in Spanish and/or delivering such interventions through bicultural clinicians or researchers. However, retention of and adherence to site-based interventions with Latinas has been challenging, along with a number of barriers to participating in PA (e.g., limited transportation, lack of personal free time). In one study, 151 Latinas were randomized to Spanish-language dance classes in \"storefront\" locations near a community clinic or to a safety education control. Although the women in the aerobic dance group reported more vigorous exercise and improved fitness compared to those in the control group, the authors noted that continuous rigorous outreach from study staff was necessary to maintain attendance at classes. To be both effective and sustainable, then, PA interventions with this population will likely need to allow for flexibility in time and location of activity, in addition to addressing other unique cultural barriers such as the expectation to put the needs of one's family before oneself. Additionally, few interventions have directly targeted psychosocial constructs shown to predict PA adoption in Latinas, signaling a need for interventions that are both culturally adapted to Latinas and targeted to populationspecific, theory-based predictors of PA. Previous research has shown that computer expert system-driven, individually tailored, theory-based print interventions (based on the transtheoretical model and social cognitive theory) can significantly increase PA in predominantly non-Hispanic white individuals. These interventions have potential for increasing PA in Latinas, as they can be delivered through the mail, allowing individuals to exercise wherever and whenever it is convenient for them.\nIn addition, these interventions incorporate theoretic constructs, such as social support and self-efficacy, shown to predict greater activity in Latinas. Therefore, formative research was conducted to culturally and linguistically adapt this intervention for Latinas, and the adapted intervention was tested (N¼93) in a pilot study. Results supported the feasibility and acceptability of using such an approach to promote PA in Latinas. The objective of the current study was to conduct a fully powered RCT (Seamos Saludables) to test the efficacy of the culturally adapted PA intervention for Latinas. It was hypothesized that, after 6 months, women randomized to the intervention arm would report significantly greater increases in weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) than those randomized to a wellness contact control condition.\n",

Recruitment involved advertising in local Spanish-language newspapers, radio and TV stations, and recruiting at Latino churches, festivals, and events.\nExclusion criteria included being positive for any item on the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q), a screening tool recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) to determine safety of adopting unsupervised physical activity. Exclusion items included a history of coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, orthopedic problems, or any other serious medical condition that could make PA unsafe, as well as current or planned pregnancy, planning to move from the area within the next 12 months, hospitalization due to a psychiatric disorder in the past 3 years, BMI 445, and/or taking medication that may impair PA tolerance (e.g., beta blockers).\n",

On return of the accelerometers, participants completed baseline PA measures and were randomly assigned to one of two Spanishlanguage print-based mail-delivered intervention conditions: PA or wellness. Group assignment was determined by a list of random numbers (using a permuted block-randomization procedure implemented in MATLAB), which was stratified by stage of change to ensure an equal distribution of various levels of motivational readiness for PA across groups. Research staff was blind to the randomization schedule.

Acculturation and health literacy were assessed using the Brief Acculturation Scale (BrAS), a four-item measure that asks about language use across various life contexts, and the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA), a measure designed to evaluate adult literacy in the healthcare setting. For a more detailed account of the measures used, see Pekmezi et al. The primary outcome measure, the 7-Day PAR, was completed at baseline and 6-month assessments. The 7-Day PAR is an interviewer-administered measure of MVPA performed during the prior week across contexts (e.g., leisure, occupation) in a minimum of 10-minute bouts. It has consistently demonstrated acceptable reliability, internal consistency, and congruent validity with other more objective measures of PA (e.g., accelerometers). It is sensitive to changes in moderate-intensity PA overtime and has good test-retest reliability among Latino participants. To corroborate the self-report 7-Day PAR data, participants also wore ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers for 7 days prior to the baseline and 6-month assessments (overlapping with the 7-Day PAR recall period). Accelerometers were used to measure both movement and intensity of activity and have been validated with heart rate telemetry and total energy expenditure. Accelerometer data was processed using ActiLife 5 software, with a cutpoint of 1952 as the minimum threshold for moderate-intensity activity and minimum activity duration of 10 minutes.\nThree psychosocial measures-stage of change, self-efficacy for PA, and the processes of change-were administered face-to-face at baseline and 6 months and via mail at 3 months. Intervention participants also completed these measures at 2, 4, and 5 months to generate the tailored expert-system feedback reports and assess for changes in theoretic constructs directly targeted by the intervention. The four-item stage-of-change measure has demonstrated reliability as well as shown acceptable concurrent validity with measures of self-efficacy and current activity levels. Self-efficacy, or confidence in one's ability to persist with exercising in various situations (e.g., when feeling fatigued, during inclement weather) was measured with a five-item instrument developed by Marcus and colleagues (alpha¼0.82). The 40-item processes measure contains ten subscales that address a variety of processes of PA behavior change. Internal consistency of the subscales ranged from 0.62 to 0.96.\n",

These reports are generated by a computer expert system and draw from a library of approximately 296 messages regarding motivation, self-efficacy, and cognitive and behavioral strategies for PA adoption based on participants' responses to questionnaires.\nThe expert system also provides feedback on progress overtime and compared to other individuals who have successfully adopted and maintained PA. Participants received pedometers and PA logs to encourage self-monitoring of PA behavior. To better meet the PA intervention needs and preferences of Latinas, the program was provided in Spanish and addressed PA barriers identified by Latinas in focus groups and in the literature review (lack of time, lack of motivation, childcare, partner support, personal empowerment, costs, inclement weather, gender roles, and body-size ideals; see Pekmezi et al. for further details).\n",

Models included random intercepts to account for within-subject correlation between repeated outcomes overtime, and SEs were adjusted to account for clustering.

Mixed-effects models use a likelihood-based approach to estimation and therefore made use of all available data without directly imputing missing outcome values. As a subsequent step, any occupational activity reported by participants  Using a longitudinal regression model implemented with generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with robust SEs, the effect of treatment assigned was examined on the probability of meeting ACSM guidelines for PA (defined as reporting Z150 minutes/week of MVPA ) at follow-up, controlling for potential confounders (in this case, variables not balanced by randomization). Specifically, binary indicators of meeting criteria on treatment assigned (intervention versus control); baseline level of PA; and potential covariates (as listed previously) were regressed using binomial errors, a logit link function, and a working unstructured correlation to accommodate within-subject correlations. The correlation between the 7-day PAR and the ActiGraph accelerometers was examined using Spearman rank correlations. The primary analysis (testing between-group differences in minutes/week of MVPA at follow-up) was repeated using data collected from the ActiGraph accelerometers at baseline and 6-month follow-up.\nFinally, as an exploratory step, between-group differences were assessed in intermediate variables targeted by the intervention, including self-efficacy, and behavioral and cognitive processes. A series of generalized linear models assessed between-group differences in each of these constructs at 3-month follow-up, controlling for baseline values and potential confounders of the intervention effect. Intermediate variables were assessed at 3 months, as they were proposed a priori as potential mediators of the intervention effect and thus were measured earlier to guarantee that the temporal precedence assumption was met.

Among the 266 women randomized at baseline, the average age was 40.67 years (SD¼9.98) and mean BMI was 29.40 (SD¼4.70). More than 90% were first-generation immigrants to the U.S., and 481% spoke only Spanish or more Spanish than English, suggesting that the group was low in acculturation. The majority were of Caribbean or South-American descent, with the largest groups being Dominican (37%) and Colombian (26%). Participants were also of limited financial means, with nearly half (47%) being unemployed and 54% reporting a family income below $20,000. A full description of the sample is provided in Table and has been presented in detail elsewhere. Significant between-group differences at baseline were found for generation status and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), p'so0.05; hence, these variables were included as covariates in all final models. Follow-up was 87% at 6 months (no differential loss to follow-up between treatment arms).\nThe median minutes/week of MVPA was zero for both PA intervention and control conditions at baseline (range was 0-35 in the intervention and 0-60 in control).

When controlling for blood pressure and generation status, there was a nearly significant treatment effect on the odds of meeting PA guidelines at 6-month follow-up (OR¼2.34, p¼0.07).\nResults also indicate a significant correlation between self-reported MVPA and objectively measured activity level at both baseline and 6 months (rho¼0.26, po0.01 at baseline and rho¼0.44, po0.01 at the 6-month followup). Note that correlations at 6 months correspond to the subsample of participants who both completed the 7-Day PAR and had available accelerometer data for the corresponding 7 days (n¼198, 74% at 6 months).

As hypothesized, both self-report and objective data show that women randomized to the intervention group reported significantly greater increases in weekly MVPA after 6 months than those randomized to the wellness control condition. Effect sizes were relatively unchanged after removing occupational activity, suggesting that changes were primarily in leisure-time PA. The increase in physical activity produced by the intervention (approximately 70 minutes/ week) may appear modest, but these changes have high potential clinical significance. Even small increases in PA can produce health benefits, especially for those who are initially inactive. Moreover, the current study achieved greater increases in PA than other interventions with this target population. Significant group differences also were found in the theoretic mediators directly targeted by the intervention. After 3 months, those in the intervention group reported significantly greater self-efficacy and cognitive and behavioral processes of change compared to control participants. These psychosocial constructs have been shown to predict PA adoption and maintenance, but there is a paucity of research examining the theoretic mechanisms of action behind PA behavior change in Latinas.

Overall, the sample was particularly low-income, with more than half reporting a yearly household income of o$20,000, suggesting that study protocols did not selectively exclude those of limited means, and less than 3% of screened participants were excluded due to low literacy. This finding is consistent with data from the focus groups, in which Latinas indicated that a printbased intervention was their preferred mode of delivery, as it would allow them to share materials with family and friends, suggesting that literacy was not a primary concern for this particular population.\nThis study has a number of strengths, including the RCT design and the diverse sample of Latinas from varying countries of origin. The majority of PA interventions with Latinos have focused on Mexican Americans, yet they may not be representative for all Latino subgroups, which differ in a number of health behaviors including PA. While Mexican Americans are the largest Latino subgroup in the U.S., other subgroups are growing at a faster rate and may suffer from a higher prevalence of chronic diseases than Mexican Americans. Therefore, the inclusion of participants from diverse countries of origin is particularly important. Additionally, the participants in the current study were generally low in acculturation, representing a hard-toreach group that often reports lower leisure-time PA than more highly acculturated Latinos.
