      "value": "Aim Residual b-cell function is present at the time of diagnosis with Type 1 diabetes. Preserving this b-cell function reduces complications. We hypothesized that exercise preserves b-cell function in Type 1 diabetes and undertook a pilot trial to address the key uncertainties in designing a definitive trial to test this hypothesis.\nMethods A randomized controlled pilot trial in adults aged 16-60 years diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes within the previous 3 months was undertaken. Participants were assigned to control (usual care) or intervention (exercise consultation every month), in a 1 : 1 ratio for 12 months. The primary outcomes were recruitment rate, dropout, exercise adherence [weeks with ≥ 150 min of self-reported moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)], and exercise uptake in the control group. The secondary outcomes were differences in insulin sensitivity and rate of loss of b-cell function between intervention and control at 6 and 12 months.\nResults Of 507 individuals who were approached, 58 (28 control, 30 intervention) entered the study and 41 completed it. Participants were largely white European males, BMI 24.8 AE 3.8 kg/m 2 , HbA 1c 75 AE 25 mmol/mol (9 AE 2%). Mean level of objectively measured MVPA increased in the intervention group (mean 243 to 273 min/week) and 61% of intervention participants reached the target of ≥ 150 min/week of self-reported MVPA on at least 42 weeks of the year. Physical activity levels fell slightly in the control group (mean 277 to 235 min of MVPA/week). There was exploratory evidence that intervention group became more insulin sensitive and required less insulin. However, the rate of loss of b-cell function appeared similar between the groups, although the change in insulin sensitivity may have affected this.\nConclusion We show that it is possible to recruit and randomize people with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes to atrial of an exercise intervention, and increase and maintain their exercise levels for 12 months. Future trials need to incorporate measures of greater adherence to exercise training targets, and include more appropriate measures of b-cell function. (Clinical Trials Registry No; ISRCTN91388505)",

      "value": "Type 1 diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic insulin-secreting b cells. Significant numbers of b cells are present at the time of diagnosis with Type 1 diabetes, but b-cell numbers and their function continue to decline following diagnosis. Preservation of bcell function has important clinical benefits. Data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) has demonstrated that a meal-stimulated 90-min C-peptide value ≥ 200 pmol/l is associated with improved glucose control, reduced risk of retinopathy and nephropathy, and with a reduction in rates of hypoglycaemia of more than a half. Therefore, interventions that can preserve residual b-cell function in new-onset Type 1 diabetes are needed clinically. Furthermore, therapies proven to preserve b-cell function in new-onset Type 1 diabetes can betaken forward into trials of Type 1 diabetes prevention.\nClinical trials of medicinal agents for b-cell preservation in new-onset Type 1 diabetes have been ongoing for over three decades. To date, none have shown significant and sustained clinical benefit. Furthermore, the adverse side effect profile of some of these agents requires a considered and cautious roll out. Although there is a continuing need for these medicinal agents to be investigated, we also need to explore new therapies with an acceptable side effect profile, and that have the potential to be used as an adjunct to the agents under investigation.\nWe have previously outlined the rationale for physical exercise as a modifier of b-cell loss, and one that should be trialled in new-onset Type 1 diabetes. In this review, we presented data from studies showing that physical exercise preserves b-cell function in animal models of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, in healthy humans and in people with impaired glucose tolerance and with Type 2 diabetes. For example, the STRRIDE study demonstrated that an 8 month walking exercise programme of 1 h of walking three times a week in people at risk of Type 2 diabetes improved b-cell function by 60%. These findings have not been tested in people with Type 1 diabetes. In our commentary, we also outlined some of the mechanisms of increased b-cell proliferation and decreased b-cell loss through which this benefit may occur. We went onto outline the need fora prospective clinical trial to test the hypothesis that exercise preserves b-cell function in people newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.\nWe undertook a pilot trial to address the key uncertainties in designing a definitive trial to test the hypothesis that exercise preserves b-cell function in new-onset Type 1 diabetes.\nPrior to this pilot trial, we undertook a qualitative study to identify barriers to uptake of and adherence to an intensive exercise programme. Here, we present the results of the subsequent pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving an exercise intervention in people with recent onset Type 1 diabetes. We decided that the exercise intervention should be non-supervised because the patients who helped us to design the study felt that a 12-month supervised exercise programme would be too onerous. In addition, we have shown that with non-supervised exercise programmes we can increase and maintain exercise level in a variety of people with chronic diseases, including those with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes.\nSpecific objectives of this pilot RCT were to:\ndetermine the proportion and characteristics of people with Type 1 diabetes who would be willing to take part in an RCT of exercise (i.e. recruitment rate); define the rates of adherence to a non-supervised exercise intervention and participant drop-out;\ndetermine the rate of exercise uptake in the non-intervention arm (i.e. intervention contamination); determine the rate of loss of b-cell function in the intervention and control arms to enable the statistical power calculations for the subsequent definitive trial to be refined; determine (as a secondary outcome) whether the 12-month exercise intervention results in a significant preservation of b-cell function;\ndevelop estimates of statistical properties of potential outcome measures that are needed for sample size calculations for the definitive trial.\n",

Our findings contradict the only other study in Type 1 diabetes adults, which did not show an increase in exercise levels.\n• We also show that an exercise programme is safe and can be undertaken without hypoglycaemia or injury, and appears to improve physical fitness and insulin sensitivity, and reduce insulin requirements.\n• We objectively measure physical activity in people with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes and show them to undertake more physical activity than previously reported.\n• In the setting of a pilot feasibility trial, the rate of loss of b-cell function does not appear to be influenced by exercise. However, the increased insulin sensitivity associated with exercise may influence the validity of meal-stimulated increases in plasma C-peptide concentration as a measure of residual b-cell function.\nHealth Service (NHS) hospitals identified people newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and provided them with information about the study.

      "value": "Using goal-oriented motivational interviewing techniques, participants in the intervention group were encouraged by the research nurse to safely increase their exercise levels according to a graded programme to at least 150 min/week of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise in bouts of at least 10 minutes, aiming for 240 min/week of exercise. Each patient was given a wrist-worn heart rate monitor (Polar, Warwick, UK) and physical activity log to record the length of exercise and the heart rate during exercise, and blood glucose before and after exercise. These logs were discussed with the research nurses and used to help monitor and encourage an increase in exercise levels. The aim was to increase exercise over the first 12 weeks of the study and then to maintain exercise levels for the remainder of the study. Any form of exercise could be undertaken and exercise could be accumulated throughout the day in bouts of at least 10 min. Participants met with the nurse for 20 min to discuss their exercise levels at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 30, 36 and 42 weeks as specified in the protocol. Using a protocol similar to this, we have shown that we can increase and maintain exercise levels in a variety of patients with chronic diseases including patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes.\nUsual care consisted of standard dietary and exercise advice after randomization and at the end of the study, with reviews by a study doctor and nurse at baseline and at 6 and 12 months, and review by a nurse alone at 3 and 9 months. Both intervention and control group received usual care. The exercise advice in the usual care arm was the provision of the local hospital document on exercise and Type 1 diabetes, and advice on the importance of exercise.\nManagement of diabetes, blood pressure and lipid profile was undertaken by the study team for the period of the trial. Any changes in treatment of these factors were made by a doctor unaware of treatment allocation, and according to a strict trial protocol, to keep the risk of performance bias to a minimum.\nMeasures were taken at baseline (pre-randomization), and at 6 and 12 months post randomization. b-Cell function was assessed using a 240 ml Fortisip mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) with blood taken for C-peptide at -10, 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. Measures of health-related quality of life (EQ-5D, CES-D, WHOQOL), diabetes distress (PAID, Illness perception), sleep quality (PSQI), exercise motivation and self-efficacy (Bandura, Deci and Ryan, outcome expectation for exercise), and diet (Toole and Glasgow) were assessed through questionnaires as outlined previously. Fitness (predicted VO 2max ) was assessed by two methods (Astrand-Ryhming and YMCA/ACSM) during a single exercise test undertaken on a calibrated cycle ergometer. Therefore, we undertook one exercise protocol, and applied two different algorithms to the same data. The mean of these two values was taken as the final measure of fitness. We opted to use a combination of two methods to reduce the error of estimated maximum oxygen uptake from these two predictive tests. Although both techniques are widely used and well-established, each is based on different assumptions and thus a combined estimate across both predictors will have lower error than relying on one estimate alone. To assess changes in objectively measured habitual physical activity, participants wore an accelerometer (GT1M; ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, FL, USA) for 7 days on a belt around the waist, except when swimming, bathing and sleeping. Accelerometers were set to record data every minute. Raw accelerometer files were processed using KineSoft (version 3.3.62; KineSoft, Saskatoon, SK, Canada). A valid day was defined as recording at least 8 h of measurement, excluding periods of ≥ 20 min with continuous zero values (considered to be nonwear time). Total physical activity was computed as the mean accelerometer cpm over the full period of valid recording. The average number of minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per valid day was computed using a threshold of ≥ 1952 cpm, equivalent to an exercise intensity of > 3 metabolic equivalents (METs). For inclusion in analyses, participants were required to record at least three valid days of accelerometer data.\nC-peptide and insulin were measured using a direct electrochemiluminescence immunoassay by the University of Exeter as previously described. The limit of the C-peptide assay is 3.3 pmol/l and that of the insulin assay is 1.39 pmol/l. Antibodies were measured at the Research Laboratories of the School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol (Southmead Hospital, Bristol, UK).\n",

In accord with the CONSORT extension for pilot studies and because we were not formally powered to detect differences in outcomes between groups, we have not calculated or presented P-values [14].\nRecruitment rates were calculated as the percentage of people with Type 1 diabetes who were contacted about the study and who consented to be involved. Adherence to exercise in the intervention group was assessed using the exercise diaries through looking at how many weeks participants reported doing > 150 min/week of MVPA in bouts of at least 10 min. We considered success as at least 80% of patients doing > 150 self-reported minutes a week of exercise for 42 weeks of the year. Forty-two weeks was picked because participants do not reach 150 min/week until week 10 into the intervention if their exercise levels were low when joining the study. Physical activity in the intervention and control groups was also assessed from the Actigraph accelerometer measures at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Withdrawal rates were calculated as the percentage of consented participants who were lost to follow-up at 12 months.\nAs per recommended guidelines for trials of b-cell preservation, b-cell response was estimated as area under curve (AUC) C-peptide and calculated for each participant applying the trapezium method. Measured C-peptide values are non-zero and simulation studies suggested that integrals estimated from trapezoidal rule outperformed all other methods when functions are non-zero. The 'minus 10' minute and 'zero' minute measure for C-peptide level was averaged to obtain the pre-meal baseline level of C-peptide and the subsequent measures were used to calculate total AUC for each participant. The subject specific AUC was further divided by 120 to obtain average AUC per minute for each person and is expressed in pmol/l. The outcome variable AUC was skewed and a log transformation with natural base was needed for regression models. The results are presented as exponentiated coefficients.\nOur analyses included all participants with complete data and based on intention to treat approach, i.e. comparison of groups by initial random allocation. For all anthropometric, biochemical and psychometric variables, we developed separate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models adjusted for their baseline score to compare groups at 6 and 12 months, and reported with standard errors (SE) and 95% CIs. For C-peptide AUC, the model was further adjusted for other baseline covariates, i.e. age, sex, HbA 1c , glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) titre/islet antigen 2 antibodies titre/ zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) titre positivity, baseline MVPA and VO 2max . The titre of GAD antibodies in particular is associated with more rapid rates of b-cell loss and it is important that this is adjusted for in the AUC analysis. All analyses were undertaken using statistical software Stata, version 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).\n",

      "value": "We met our pilot trial objectives. We found that 11% of adults identified with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes were willing to take part in this study, 29% subsequently dropped out, 61% of participants reached the exercise target of > 150 min/week of moderate intensity exercise on at least 42 weeks of the year, and there was no evidence of exercise uptake in participants allocated to the control group. We also show that people with Type 1 diabetes who would be willing to take part in atrial of exercise are largely white European males of healthy BMI, a mean age of 32 years, and a third test negative for islet autoantibodies. We show for the first time that an unsupervised exercise programme can increase physical exercise levels of moderate intensity and above in adults newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes by 30 min/week and maintain this over 12 months. This is in contrast to the control arm where there was a fall in physical activity levels by 42 min/week over the equivalent period. We also show that this exercise programme is safe and can be undertaken without hypoglycaemia or injury, and appears to improve physical fitness and insulin sensitivity, and reduce insulin requirements. We would caution that the submaximal VO 2max protocol used to estimate fitness is reliant on heart rate and has not been validated in a Type 1 diabetes population. However, autonomic dysfunction is unlikely in a newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes patient and therefore we would propose that the estimates of VO 2max are likely to be reliable.\nAlso in the context of a feasibility study, using standard measures of b-cell function, our data does not prove that the exercise programme preserves b-cell function.\nThese findings will be used to help design future studies to determine whether exercise preserves b-cell function in adults newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. However, some aspects of the data from this trial are worth discussing in greater detail, both to aid refining future intervention trials, and because it provides details of the characteristics and natural history of adults newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. This is the first study to demonstrate that an unsupervised exercise programme can increase and maintain physical exercise in adult people with Type 1 diabetes. In the pilot program for physical exercise promotion in adults with Type diabetes: the PEP-1 program, the only other unsupervised exercise programme for adults with Type 1 diabetes, activity was not increased. In four studies of unsupervised exercise studies in adolescents and/or children, two showed an increased activity at 3-4 months and two did not.\nThe results of our study are consistent with studies in adults with Type 2 diabetes in which we and others have demonstrated that an unsupervised exercise programme can increase and maintain physical activity fora year and longer. Furthermore, the increase in moderate to physical activity in our study is similar to that we have demonstrated in adults with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. Adherence to our exercise targets was less than reported in other studies with only 61% of participants obtaining our minimal exercise target. We had hoped to increase the volume and intensity of exercise more than was observed. Further research on exercise adherence, and obtaining higher intensity and volumes of exercise is required in adults with Type 1 diabetes.\nWe also believe this to be the first study to objectively measure physical activity in newly diagnosed people with Type 1 diabetes. Studies of people with long-standing Type 1 diabetes where physical activity was self-reported suggested that 36-44% of them were doing less than one session of exercise per week. In our study of exercise in people with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes, objectively measured MVPA was 285 min/week, much higher than previously reported. This may not represent all newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes adults because people with an exercise interest are preferentially attracted to participate in such studies. However, these activity levels are similar to healthy non-diabetic people in the USA, and less than that seen in participants in UK Biobank study and in across sectional study of people in Bristol, UK. Regardless, we were surprised that the mean level of physical activity was only 37 min/day which is only 11 min/day more than newly diagnosed people with Type 2 diabetes who were twice as old. Although we were not formally powered to compare groups, improvement in metabolic variables with exercise detected in our study is broadly similar to those already reported (reviewed Ref.). Our study detected improvements in mean HDL of 4.7% (8-30% in published studies), triglyceride of 10% (13-15% in published studies) and insulin resistance of 20% (up to 23% in published studies). In line with other studies, there was no improvement in glycaemic control with exercise.\nThe fall in C-peptide of 11% in our study was lower than rates of 25% in the year following diagnosis reported in other studies. This maybe contributed to by the older age of our participants because older age has been associated with a more gradual fall in C-peptide.\nThe secondary outcome measure of b-cell function measured by AUC C-peptide did not differ between the intervention and control groups. This maybe because sufficient volume or intensity of exercise was not achieved.\nWhereas some of the studies demonstrating an improvement in b-cell function with exercise observed exercise levels of > 200 min MVPA (achieved by many of our participants), others reported exercise levels of > 300 min/week. Intensity of the exercise may also be important. In animal studies and studies of people at risk of Type 2 diabetes, moderate intensity exercise preserves b cells to a greater extent than high intensity exercise. For this reason, our protocol was designed to increase levels of moderate intensity exercise. If the mechanisms (immunity, hormones, cytokines) underlying the protective effective of exercise differs between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, different intensities may need to be targeted for b-cell preservation in a Type 1 diabetes population. Further studies into the efficacy of different exercise intensities and volumes on b-cell function in Type 1 diabetes will be needed to determine this.\nAnother reason why a difference in AUC C-peptide was not seen between the two groups maybe that this measure underestimates b-cell function in the face of increasing insulin sensitivity. Less insulin is required for glucose homeostasis in an insulin-sensitive state. Therefore when bcell function is stable, an insulin sensitizing intervention will result in a fall in the AUC C-peptide measure. This fall in AUC C-peptide should not be interpreted as a fall in b-cell function, but rather as an adaptive decrease in insulin secretion for the increasing insulin sensitivity. The analysis in Fig. supports the concept that an increase in insulin sensitivity associates with an appropriate decrease in the AUC C-peptide measure of b-cell function. This association therefore makes it difficult to use the AUC C-peptide as an accurate measure of b-cell function in interventions that alter insulin sensitivity. Therefore, b-cell outcome measures for exercise studies in Type 1 diabetes need to account for the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity. In our study, the intervention group maintained their AUC C-peptide measure despite becoming more insulin sensitive, consistent with this group effecting a 'real' increase in b-cell function. Exercise interventions for preservation of b-cell function in Type 2 diabetes that have not accounted for changes in insulin sensitivity have provided conflicting results, whereas studies that have accounted for insulin sensitivity change have reported more consistently. We have used disposition index in the further analysis of our data because it is an established measure of b-cell function that models for insulin sensitivity. Although this approach to measuring bcell function has not been validated in Type 1 diabetes, its use suggests that in our study, b-cell function corrected for improved insulin sensitivity is preserved with exercise (Fig.).\nThe dropout rate of 29% in this study is about twice that originally predicted in the study design, and described in studies of immunotherapeutic agents for new-onset Type 1 diabetes. Our previous study of exercise intervention in people with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes only reported a 3% dropout rate. However, the current study population was younger and in full time employment. Higher dropout rates have been reported in other exercise studies. Ina recent meta-analysis of unsupervised exercise programmes, 20% of studies had a dropout of > 20%, 32% a dropout of 10-20%, and 48% a dropout of < 10%. It is relevant that most of the dropouts were due to lack of time, and within the first month. We have undertaken qualitative interviews with our trial participants around trial retention. A clearer description of the time commitment required for such a study, more flexible appointments, improved feedback of results, more consistent healthcare support, and a prolonged 1 month 'runin' phase may address this high dropout rate.\nIn summary, we have shown that it is possible to recruit newly diagnosed people with Type 1 diabetes to an exercise study. We have also shown that we can safely increase and maintain exercise levels in these participants and that this is not deleterious to b-cell function. We believe it is now important to take forward this pilot study with a fully powered trial to definitively confirm whether exercise training can preserve b-cell function in Type 1 diabetes. Exercise training is likely to bean affordable intervention that can be undertaken without significant adverse events, has many parallel benefits (cardiovascular risk, well-being, increasing insulin sensitivity, etc.), and can be used as an adjunctive therapy. However, this pilot study highlights that prior to undertaking full trial, we need to confirm the optimum approach to measuring b-cell function in an environment of changing insulin sensitivity, and improve our non-supervised exercise programmes so we can maintain greater adherence to exercise in adults with Type 1 diabetes.\n",
