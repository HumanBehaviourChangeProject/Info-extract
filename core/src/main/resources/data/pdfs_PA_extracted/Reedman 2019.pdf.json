Design: Randomized waitlist-controlled trial. Setting: Home and community. Participants: Children classified at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I-III were recruited (nZ37; 18 males; mean age AE SD, 10.0AE1.4y) from a population-based register. Interventions: Participants were randomized to ParticiPAte CP (an 8-wk goal-directed, individualized, participation-focused therapy delivered by a physical therapist) or waitlist usual care. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Accelerometers were worn for objective measurement of HPA (min/d moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA], sedentary time). Barriers to participation, community participation, and quality-of-life outcomes were also collected. Data were analyzed by intention-to-treat using generalized estimating equations.\nResults: ParticiPAte CP led to significant improvements in goal performance (mean difference [MD]Z3.58; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.19-4.97; P<.001), satisfaction (MDZ1.87; 95% CI, 0.37-3.36, PZ.014), and barriers to participation (MDZ26.39; 95% CI, 6.13-46.67; PZ.011) compared with usual care at 8 weeks. There were no between-group differences on minutes per day of MVPA at 8 weeks (MDZ1.17; 95% CI, À13.27 to 15.61; PZ.874). There was a significant difference in response to intervention between participants who were versus were not meeting HPA guidelines at baseline (MDZ15.85; 95% CI, 3.80-27.89; P<.0061). After ParticiPAte CP, low active participants had increased average MVPA by 5.98AE12.16 minutes per day. Conclusion: ParticiPAte CP was effective at increasing perceived performance of leisure-time physical activity goals in children with CP GMFCS I-III by reducing modifiable barriers to participation. This did not translate into change in HPA on average; however, low active children may have a clinically meaningful response.",

      "value": "Participation is defined as involvement in a life situation as part of the fulfilment of asocial role. Children with cerebral palsy (CP) participate less frequently and in fewer types of leisure-time physical activities than their typically developing peers. Children with CP are at greater risk for physical inactivity including reduced time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and increased sedentary behaviors, and are less likely to meet Australian physical activity guidelines. Australian guidelines recommend that all children aged 5-12 years need to accumulate at least 60 minutes per day of MVPA. Participation in physical activities and daily (habitual) physical activity (HPA) are correlated in children with CP. An intervention that aims to increase participation in physical activities may therefore increase MVPA and/or reduce sedentary behavior.\nPrevious studies of physical activity interventions in children with CP have targeted impairments (eg, strength) or activity limitations (eg, motor skills) under the premise that improvement at these levels translates to increased participation and/or MVPA. Used alone, these impairment-focused approaches are insufficient to increase participation or HPA. Biopsychosocial models of disability recognize that participation restrictions are not caused directly by impairments or activity limitations. Therapy models that integrate strategies aimed at personal, contextual, and environmental factors maybe more effective at enabling participation in physical activities and improving HPA. Participation-based therapy aims to enable participation in children using a goaloriented, family-centered, collaborative, strengths-based, ecological, and self-determined process. There are no randomized controlled trials of interventions aligned with participation-based therapy, though recent goal-directed therapies including environmental and behavior-changing components have emerging evidence of efficacy in nonrandomized studies. ParticiPAte CP is a participation-focused therapy for children with cerebral palsy, targeting barriers to participation in leisuretime physical activity across domains of child and family health, functioning, and behavior. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of ParticiPAte CP on (1) perceived performance and satisfaction with participation in leisure-time physical activity goals and (2) objectively measured physical activity behaviors (HPA) in children with CP. We hypothesized that participants receiving the intervention would demonstrate significantly greater participation goal performance and satisfaction, more minutes per day of MVPA, and reduced sedentary time compared with a group receiving usual care. Secondary aims were to assess the efficacy of ParticiPAte CP on parent-reported behavioral barriers to participation, domains of child-reported quality of life, and parentreported community participation frequency and involvement.\n",

      "value": "In this randomized controlled trial, participants receiving Partici-PAte CP achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in performance of self-selected leisure-time physical activity goals, compared to the control group. This model of participation-focused therapy enabled children with CP to participate in leisure-time physical activities that met their needs and preferences using a toolbox of strategies to target individualized, modifiable barriers to participation in physical activity. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized trial of participationfocused therapy to improve participation in physical activities in children with CP.\nImproved goal performance did not translate into increased minutes per day of MVPA. Children with CP who did not meet physical activity guidelines at baseline, however, exhibited an increase in MVPA in response to ParticiPAte CP compared to children who already performed !60 minutes per day of MVPA. Most children in the study set frequency of attendance goals saying they would like to participate in an activity on more occasions. Given this, it is plausible that low active children had an additional 60-120 minutes per week of participation in their goal activities after ParticiPAte CP. If approximately one-third of this time can be attributed to MVPA intensity, up to an extra 40 minutes per week (w6min/d) of MVPA maybe expected. This corresponds to the effect size found in the pooled analysis in low active children, demonstrating that this effect maybe clinically meaningful.\nParticipants in both groups had moderate-high levels of MVPA at baseline when GMFCS-specific cut points were applied. Children with CP have a higher energy cost of walking than typically developing children, which increases with increasing GMFCS level. Validated GMFCS-specific cut points are less likely to misclassify activity intensity for children GMFCS II and III compared to nonspecific cut points. Despite a relatively small sample, this was demonstrated in the current study as when GMFCS-specific cut points were applied, GMFCS did not predict minutes per day of MVPA, indicating that children at GMFCS II and III maybe more physically active than previously estimated. Machine learning approaches such as activity class recognition may offer better means to detect both intensity of HPA and activity type (eg, walking vs aerobic sports vs cycling). Activity class recognition is a different method of data reduction (using the same devices) that relies first on detecting the type of activity before applying intensity cut points. This may improve the ability to detect change after an intervention aimed to change participation in individually chosen physical activities. Cycling and swimming goals were however frequently chosen in this study. Furthermore, ActiGraph GT3Xþ are not waterproof and cut point methods with hip wear location are likely to underestimate cycling intensity. It is therefore possible that for some participants, MVPA was underestimated.\nParticiPAte CP was underpinned by theories of human motivation and behavior, including SDT. Motivational interviewing communication strategies (which are consistent with SDT in supporting client autonomy 37 ) were used to help children and caregivers resolve ambivalence to increasing physical activity participation. After ParticiPAte CP, caregivers reported significantly fewer behavioral barriers and/or more facilitators to their child's participation on the BPPA-Q. Furthermore, there were between-group differences at both 8 and 16 weeks on the BiGSS. This supported the hypothesized mechanism of effect that Partici-PAte CP would (1) facilitate participant autonomy and self-efficacy, leading to (2) intrinsic motivation for physical activity behavior change, through (3) reduction of modifiable barriers to participation.\nThe solution-focused approach used in ParticiPAte CP to overcoming barriers to participation has similarities to the Teens Making Environment and Activity Modifications project, Pathways and Resources for Engagement and Participation intervention, and the Local Environment Model. All feature problem-solving approaches, rely on a degree of child and youth involvement and are targeted toward environmental and behavioral barriers to participation. ParticiPAte CP differs from Teens Making Environment and Activity Modifications and Pathways and Resources for Engagement and Participation by its inclusion of child-related strategies, such as functional training (to increase activity capacity). Scaffolded participation in physical activities is also included in the Local Environment Model. Although there were no between-group differences for community participation frequency and community environmental supportiveness, there were small within-group improvements in the intervention group at 16 weeks. It is not clear whether this change is clinically meaningful PEM-CY, though a similar magnitude of change was reported after a pilot trial in 6 participants with CP (MDZ0.6). The PEM-CY community domain captures aspects of participation in 10 community activity types with only 2 being physical activities. Because the intervention was targeted at physical activities only, change across other activity types would not be expected. In addition, the PEM-CY has a 4-month recall period, meaning there was a recall time overlap of 2 months prior to baseline at the 8-week time point, which may have reduced the ability to detect change attributable to the intervention. This could be overcome by selecting a longer followup period or shortening the recall window.\nThe therapy did not lead to improvements in child-reported quality of life. A ceiling effect of the Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire for Children 41 may influence the result given the proportion of high scores at baseline. In addition, a proportion of participating children had a comorbid diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability, and/or a learning disability, which may have affected their ability to reliably selfreport quality of life. Future studies may use both parentproxy and child self-report measures.\n",
