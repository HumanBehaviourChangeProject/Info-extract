      "value": "Obesity is a potentially debilitating condition, and many obesity-related risk factors and diseases are strikingly apparent in minority populations. An expert committee convened by the American Medical Association (2) recommended de ning obesity in children as a BMI at or above the 95th percentile forage and sex. Using this de nition, for non-Hispanic black children, 11.4% of 2-5 year olds, 19.4% of 6-11 year olds, and 24.4% of 12-19 year olds were obese in.\nerefore, the preschool years may represent a crucial time for interventions designed to alter the trajectory toward obesity in black children.\ne Hip-Hop to Health Jr. Obesity Prevention E ectiveness Trial builds on the results of a successful e cacy trial, Hip-Hop to Health Jr.. In that study, specially trained early childhood educators visited preschools and taught either a 14-week nutrition and physical activity intervention or a general health intervention. Results showed that children in the intervention group had signi cantly smaller increases in BMI than children in the control group at year 1 and year 2 follow-up. However, an intervention taught by visiting educators is potentially difcult to disseminate. erefore, we designed a similar intervention that could be integrated into the everyday preschool curriculum and delivered by classroom teachers. e primary aim of this study is to compare BMI and BMI Z score changes in the intervention and control groups 1 year a er the intervention. Secondary aims include comparing physical activity, screen time, and diet in the two groups at the postintervention visit and at the 1-year follow-up visit. Analyses for the primary outcome are in progress. is article describes the study design, characteristics of the participants at baseline, feasibility of teacher training and session completion, and changes in BMI, physical activity, screen time, and diet at the postintervention visit.\n",

Finally, we did not collect data on the social context in which people were living and making decisions related to their health and the health of their children. is rich area of research is increasingly recognized as crucial in order to better understand how to design interventions and interpret results.\nOverall, the results of this e ectiveness trial suggest that an evidence-based intervention tested in an e cacy trial can be adapted for delivery by classroom teachers and can produce changes in physical activity and screen time. e nal test of the intervention will be whether we observe di erences in BMI and BMI Z score changes between the intervention and control groups at the 1-year follow-up visit. Our results underscore the need to expand our interventions outside the classroom and to understand how best to accommodate low-income families in obesity prevention e orts.\n",

In thee cacy trial, the intervention was delivered three times per week. However, in response to teacher feedback regarding scheduling, we adapted the curriculum so that teachers were asked to teach two weekly sessions, with the option of including a third session if they chose. Each week focused on a particular theme with a speci c objective (see Table). Each session included a 20-min lesson related to healthy eating and exercise, as well as a 20-min physical activity component. Lessons featured the colorful \"Pyramid Puppets\" that represent the seven food groups of the food pyramid. In addition, the intervention incorporated songs and raps that were included on a CD for teachers to play for their students. e CD also included two fully scripted exercise routines.\nParents in the TD-WCI classrooms received a weekly newsletter that paralleled the children's curriculum in content and included a homework assignment. Parents received $5 for each of the homework assignments that they completed and returned. Each parent also received the same CD that the teacher used in the classroom so that the nutrition concepts and importance of physical activity could be reinforced in the home. TD-GHI. e TD-GHI was based on the control intervention used in thee cacy trial. It was 14 weeks long and taught once per week. e children learned a variety of health concepts, including car seat and seat belt safety, immunizations, dental health, and the procedures for calling 911. Parents received a weekly newsletter that mirrored the weekly theme of the school-based curriculum but were not asked to complete homework assignments.\nCultural adaptations. In our original WCI and in the current TD-WCI, we targeted six areas related to cultural practices and beliefs: food, family, music, community, social roles, and relationships. Cultural considerations included targeting culturally relevant foods and augmenting traditional recipes to be low-fat; including family members through the parent newsletters; using culturally relevant music and dance; addressing cognitive (knowledge and attitudes) and environmental (social support, unsafe neighborhoods, economic restrictions, con icting responsibilities) barriers to regular physical activity and healthful eating, and facilitating social support and self-e cacy in making changes in diet and physical activity.\n",

Weight was measured using a Tanita BWB-800 digital scale (Tanita Corporation of America, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL).

Pearson and Spearman correlation coe cients were used to test for associations between BMI and other variables, and t-tests were used to test for di erences between obese and nonobese children. To test for di erences between groups in BMI and BMI Z score change at postintervention, we used both mixed-model analysis of variance, controlling for school and classroom nested within school, and mixedmodel analysis of covariance, controlling for school, classroom nested within school, the baseline value, and baseline age. Change from baseline to postintervention was the dependent variable. We used mixedmodel analysis of covariance to test for di erences between groups in physical activity, screen time, and diet at postintervention, controlling for school, classroom nested within school, the baseline value, and baseline age.

School-based programs are o en seen as an ideal setting for prevention e orts because most children attend school, and minority children, who are at highest risk, can participate at no cost. e Hip-Hop to Health Jr. Obesity Prevention E ectiveness Trial was designed to test an adapted version of an intervention that was shown to be successful. In an e cacy trial (5-7), specially trained early childhood educators on the study sta delivered the intervention; in the current trial, the intervention was adapted so that it could be taught by classroom teachers. For reasons of both sustainability and cost, it is necessary to conduct translational research to demonstrate how toe ectively move successful interventions from experimental studies to real-world settings, especially settings that serve high-risk and underserved populations. us, this study can be viewed as an important step in determining the feasibility of translating a successful preschool-based, minority-focused obesity prevention program into a form that is potentially easier to disseminate widely. Training and supervision of the teachers, however, proved more time-intensive than we initially anticipated. As in other teacher-delivered obesity prevention interventions, the classroom teachers received several training sessions and were provided with detailed dietary and physical activity curricula. From the beginning, the teachers were more comfortable delivering the didactic nutrition information, but wanted more guidance in how to structure the delivery of the physical activity segments. e teachers expressed di culty in delivering the physical activity for two primary reasons. First, many of the children were initially resistant to engaging in activity fora full 20 min and became distracted as they grew tired. Second, many of the teachers were not accustomed to engaging in exercise themselves, and some had physical limitations that made exercise challenging. erefore, we needed to provide weekly individualized supervision to discuss strategies for engaging the children in exercise, as well as any other di culties the teacher was experiencing. We also decided to create a CD that mirrored the weekly curriculum so that the teachers could improve their delivery of the intervention. is need for more in-depth work with the teachers was unexpected, but a very\n",
