On completion of 1-week baseline measures, the 254 participants were randomized to either the control or intervention group (1:1 ratio). Both groups had access to the standard TravelVu app (Trivector AB) for monitoring their AT for 6 months. The intervention group also received a 3-month behavior change program to promote AT (TravelVu Plus app). Assessors of outcomes were blinded to group allocation. Outcomes were objectively measured MVPA at 3 (primary) and 6 months. Secondary outcomes were AT, attitudes toward AT, and health-related quality of life at 3 and 6 months.\nResults: No effect on MVPA was observed after 3 months (P=.29); however, at 6 months the intervention group had a greater improvement in MVPA than the controls (6.05 minutes per day [95% CI 0.36 to 11.74; P=.04]). A Bayesian analyses showed that there was a 98% probability that the intervention had any effect at 6 months, and a 63% probability that this effect was >5 minute MVPA per day.\nNo effect on MVPA immediately after the intervention period (at 3 months) was observed; however, there was a delayed effect on MVPA (6 minutes per day) at 6 months, which corresponds to approximately 30% of the weekly MVPA recommendation. Our findings suggest that a behavior change program promoting AT delivered via an app may have a relevant effect on PA.",

      "value": "Physical inactivity (little or no physical activity) is a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and premature death and contributes to high healthcare costs in both high-and low-income countries. Low-cost, scalable interventions aimed at increasing habitual physical activity (PA) at the population level are warranted. Active transportation (AT; ie, cycling and walking as mode of transportation) represents a key target since AT is easily accessible and enables regular PA on a daily basis. A recent meta-analysis (23 prospective studies, n=531,333) concluded that AT was associated with decreased mortality and lower risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Also, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) support that AT by bicycle can improve health markers such as insulin sensitivity and cardiorespiratory fitness. However, to date, behavioral interventions targeting AT to increase daily PA in adults are few, and trials have been of mixed quality, with considerable variation in sample characteristics, study duration, and outcomes. Furthermore, population-based RCTs assessing the effects of AT on PA in healthy adults using objective measures for both AT and PA are lacking.\nMobile health (mHealth) interventions are increasingly being used to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and include the use of mobile apps, which offer potential to be delivered at scale. To the best of our knowledge, only one app has focused on promotion of AT. In that study, Bopp et al evaluated whether a campaign with self-monitoring of AT (via an app) together with social media and marketing components could increase AT among students and employees at a university campus. Results showed an increase in the number of self-reported active trips by students. However, due to the multicomponent nature of the intervention, it was not possible to evaluate the effect of the app component alone. Also, it was a single group study and only included self-reported travel. Thus, further well-conducted RCTs evaluating whether an app can promote AT are warranted. This paper reports the results of the Smart City Active Mobile Phone Intervention (SCAMPI) trial. The aim of this trial was to determine the effectiveness of a 3-month mobile phone-based behavior change program promoting AT on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in Swedish adults. The primary outcome was MVPA at 3 months, while secondary outcomes included MVPA at 6 months as well as time spent in AT, perceptions about AT, and health-related quality of life at 3 and 6 months.\n",

Thereafter, baseline measures of PA (using the wGT3X-BT accelerometer [ActiGraph LLC]) as well as AT (measured through the TravelVu app [Trivector AB], standard version) were assessed simultaneously during 7 consecutive days. The details of the TravelVu app have been provided in the study protocol. Briefly, the app passively collected data using GPS coordinates and presented total and mode-specific travel minutes per day (for walking, cycling, car, train, ferry, or bus). At the end of each day during these 7 days, participants were asked to review and, if necessary, manually revise travel and locations in the app. After making the needed revisions to their travel routes, participants were instructed to approve these days by marking them as valid.

Briefly, it was anchored in social cognitive theory as well as social ecological principles and included features such as a goal-setting function, messages (sent as push notifications), and feedback. In-app features encouraged participants to set new AT goals on a weekly basis. Feedback on participants' AT and progress toward the set weekly goal were provided in graphical form throughout the week. At the end of the week, push notifications were used to provide textual feedback on AT performance (ie, feedback on behavior) if PA goals were reached (ie, feedback on outcome of behavior) or to encourage modifying goal according to achievement (ie, review behavior goal). Furthermore, information on all achieved weekly goals thus far was provided graphically. Push notifications were also sent with general information on AT and its health and climate benefits as well as practical tips and behavior change strategies (Multimedia Appendix 1). After 3 months, the enhanced features were disabled and the intervention group had access to the standard version (ie, the TravelVu app) for the remaining study period (3 to 6 months after baseline) and could continue to monitor their AT. This enabled us to assess to what extent they used the self-monitoring of AT during the follow-up period and whether this was different from the control group.\n",

Linear mixed models (random intercept) were used to contrast differences in primary (MVPA) and secondary outcomes (AT, RAND-36 general health, attitudes toward using AT) between the intervention and control group. Outcomes were regressed against group allocation and included a group Ã time interaction term to incorporate repeated measures (0, 3, and 6 months).\nThree-way interaction analyses were performed to assess if the following characteristics at baseline moderated the intervention effect on the primary outcome: sex, age, educational attainment, BMI, foreign background, season of randomization, perceived walkability index, attitude toward AT, or general health. We also examined whether the effect on MVPA was associated with engagement with the app (number of registered days as well as number of goals set and achieved in the app).\nDue to relatively few missing values in the outcome measures (30/252, 11.9%, and 34/252, 13.5%, at 3-and 6-month follow-ups, respectively) and since we could not rule out the possibility that data were missing at random, we followed the recommendations to report completers only as the primary analyses. A sensitivity analysis where missing data for the primary outcome at the 3-and 6-month follow-ups were imputed using multiple imputation with chained equations (predictive mean matching, with 500 imputations and 30 iterations) was also conducted. Deviations from the missing completely at random assumption were evaluated through attrition analysis where baseline characteristics for completers and noncompleters were compared.\nWe also conducted the following analyses that were added to the statistical analysis plan before data analysis but not reported in the protocol. First, since AT mainly corresponds to MPA, the largest component of MVPA, we also used linear mixed models to contrast MPA between the two groups. Furthermore, recent data indicate that even light PA may reduce premature mortality, and since we cannot exclude that some AT would be light PA, we also ran models with light PA as outcome. Additionally, we explored whether accelerometer wear time influenced our results; however, our estimates remained similar after adjustment (results not shown). Finally, in exploratory analyses, Bayesian inference for the linear mixed models was employed to calculate the probability that the intervention had an effect on MVPA. These Bayesian analyses provided a more robust view of the data collected in the trial due to the following reasons: (1) P values and confidence intervals are not well defined in linear mixed models and should therefore only betaken as approximate and (2) null hypothesis testing can be sensitive to individual data points. Uniform priors were used for all parameters in the Bayesian analyses.\nStatistical analyses were performed with a significance level of .05 using R version 3.6.1, and Bayesian inference was done using the probabilistic programming language Stan (RStan version 2.19.1, both R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and SPSS Statistics version 24 (IBM Corporation).\n",

      "value": "To the best of our knowledge, only one previous study evaluated the effectiveness of an app designed to solely promote AT. In that study, an increase in self-reported AT to campus among 563 university students was reported; however, it was not possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the app alone since it was part of a multicomponent intervention. In our study, there are several possible explanations for why there was an intervention effect at 6 months but not at 3 months. First, the intervention group may have needed a longer time period to achieve a behavior change (ie, increase their AT). Thus, even though the intervention group was less engaged in the app after 3 months when the behavior change features were disabled, it maybe speculated that they had found strategies during the intervention and then applied those strategies to increase AT (detectable at 6 months). Second, in accordance with the predetermined study protocol, both groups had access to the TravelVu app in order to objectively assess AT during 7 days at baseline and the two follow-ups. Although the control group did not receive the 3-month enhanced app features, it is possible that using the standard app, anchored in self-monitoring, made them aware of their PA pattern and thus influenced them to engage in more PA in the beginning of the study period and potentially diluted the intervention effect at 3 months. Future studies should investigate whether use of the TravelVu Plus app would result in a larger difference when compared with a control group with no app use.\nIt is also relevant to compare our results with other app-based PA interventions. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have concluded that mobile phone-based interventions may have small to moderate effect sizes when it comes to improving PA in free-living adults. A recent study showed a mean increase in daily step count of between 226 and 319 steps associated with four different types of mobile phone interventions, which equated to around 5% of the mean daily step count for American adults (4700 steps per day). Thus, our findings are comparable to previous app-based PA interventions and extend available literature since we only targeted AT as a PA behavior.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial that evaluated objectively assessed AT via GPS monitoring instead of using self-report as a secondary outcome. This approach relied on\n",

      "value": "Strengths of the SCAMPI trial include the RCT design, as well as the objectively measured primary outcome (MVPA). Previous studies on AT and PA are mostly observational, and systematic reviews have called for well-designed interventions targeting AT. The included Bayesian analyses further strengthen the hypothesis that the TravelVu Plus app helped individuals increase their MVPA.\nThe main limitation of this study is that the primary outcome (MVPA) was assessed by accelerometry which does not capture cycling behavior; however, this choice was carefully considered when designing the study. Notwithstanding its limitations, an objective measure of PA was considered preferable to self-report as there is no well-established and objective measure to assess AT (walking and cycling). We also complemented the accelerometer data with GPS data to assess AT (walking and cycling) as the secondary outcome. The GPS data indicated that in our study approximately 90% of AT was walking, which was captured with accelerometry. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that most likely our effects on MVPA are slightly underestimated due to the fact that the accelerometer could not capture cycling. Also, we cannot exclude that some AT could be light PA instead of MVPA; however, no difference was found when contrasting light PA between groups. Another important limitation to consider is seasonality. Sweden has a relatively cold climate with a winter period between December and February; however, the autumn and spring months can also be quite cold and snowy, which does not facilitate AT. As described above, we recruited in two waves (early autumn and early spring) in order to spread the intervention period out throughout different seasons, and we did not find any evidence that the effectiveness of the intervention differed upon which season participants entered the trial. Finally, other limitations of this trial include that automated feedback messages were used instead of personalized, that the review and correction of the automatically captured AT was considered time-consuming by some participants, and that the app consumed quite a lot of battery power (as indicated in the postintervention qualitative interviews, reported separately).\nTo minimize the risk for selection bias, recruitment was population-based with a sample randomly drawn by Statistics Sweden. Nevertheless, as is common in research, the willingness to participate was higher among women and well-educated people. However, the effect was not moderated by baseline educational attainment. Furthermore, both groups had on average 60 minutes MVPA at baseline. No comparable population-based data regarding MVPA exists in Sweden, and comparisons between studies are difficult due to different protocols and accelerometer cut points; however, previous studies in Swedish adult populations have shown approximately 35 minutes of MVPA per day. Thus, although a random sample was drawn, we cannot exclude that people who signed up had a relatively physically active lifestyle, and the potential of the TravelVU Plus app to promote AT in more sedentary populations should be explored. Also, we cannot generalize our results to people who recently migrated to Sweden since the app is currently only available in Swedish. Finally, it is relevant to note that Stockholm is a city amenable to AT (walking and cycling); however, many cities and suburbs across the world are not, which may limit generalizability to other types of cities as well as limit the reach of interventions targeting only AT. Thus, future studies should evaluate the potential of apps to promote AT similar to the TravelVU Plus app in other types of cities and contexts.\n",

      "value": "The SCAMPI trial provides several important findings and insights for future interventions targeting AT. First, objective measures showed that the TravelVu Plus app was used frequently for 3 months, indicating its potential for promoting AT. This finding was supported by the in-depth interviews with a subsample (reported separately). Furthermore, this qualitative data suggested the need for improvements such as personalized messages and an improved function for registrations, preferably automatized if possible, for correction of travel trips in the app. These improvements may enhance the effectiveness of the app. Second, we were able to observe a 6-minute difference in MVPA in the intervention group compared with the control group at 6 months. The observed effect is modest; however, considering that 6 minutes per day adds up to 42 minutes per week which corresponds to nearly 30% of the recommendation (150 minutes MVPA per week) and it was achieved through a low-cost and scalable intervention, this finding is important. In this context it is also important to highlight that, due to the 24-hour continuum, adding time in AT is a reduction of time spent in other activities-in this case most likely a reduction in sedentary time (replacing motor transport) which also has positive health implications. Previous data indicate that Swedish adults spend as much as 60% of their total time as sedentary and also that very small substitutions of sedentary time for MPA have shown decreased risks for metabolic syndrome. Also, it maybe speculated that the observed effect might have been larger if the control group did not have access to the app for the measurement of AT.
