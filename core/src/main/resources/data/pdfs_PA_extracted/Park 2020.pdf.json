Indeed, exercise regimens have been shown to alleviate several adverse effects of ADT, such as cardiovascular disease, fatigue, metabolic syndrome, depression, and osteoporosis. Although the majority of physicians believe in the beneficial effect of exercise to improve QoL, the results of a European Web-based survey showed that only one-third of the respondents promoted exercise treatment due to the lack of time and low availability of supervised programs. Moreover, the distribution of educational materials alone, in the absence of other interventions, has been insufficient to motivate the patient to initiate or increase physical activity (PA). A supervised exercise program should be individually tailored to meet the patient's needs according to their diagnosis, comorbidity, and their general fitness and safety. A self-report questionnaire is the most commonly used tool to assess physical activity when counseling patients. Bourke et al reported results from a randomized trial that investigated the effect of lifestyle modification program on the QoL of patients with PCa receiving ADT. In that study, positive results were reported based on self-report questionnaires. However, self-reporting methods are known to underestimate the time spent in sedentary behavior (SB) and overestimate the time and degree of physical activity (PA). Therefore, objective measurements using accelerometry are warranted to provide reliable estimates of PA and SB, and to provide tailored exercise supervision.\nCurrent evidence supports the use of exercise interventions to improve QoL in men with PCa receiving ADT. However, there is little evidence to support which combination of supportive measures would result in a clinically meaningful improvement in QoL. In this study, we report the results of a randomized-controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of a structured lifestyle modification program for improving and sustaining QoL in men on long-term ADT.\n",

      "value": "A physically active lifestyle is key to maintaining good mental health and QoL in older adults. According to a previous study using accelerometers to assess activity, men over 60 years of age were found to spend 71% of the day engaged in SB. Exercise among the older men was mostly low-intensity PA, and only one percent of the day was devoted to MVPA. A sedentary lifestyle is negatively associated with QoL and depression in older adults. Given that the rate of depression in American men receiving ADT is 8-fold greater than in the general male population and 32-fold greater than in men over 65 years of age, it is important to offer lifestyle modification programs to patients on long-term ADT. The strength of our structured lifestyle intervention program was the multimodal approach we implemented to maximize the frequency and intensity of PA and to reduce SB. First, at enrollment, patients were provided education to promote both light PA and MVPA, as well as to reduce SB by a team of sports science specialists. This education included encouragement to engage in exercise programs tailored to the individual patient based on their subjective physical and mental health questionnaire responses, and assessment of objective accelerometer-monitored SB and PA during the preceding 4 weeks. For instance, patients with axial bone metastases who had been engaging in vigorous PA were given recommendations to engage in light-to-moderate PA, reduce SB, and refrain from weight-bearing exercise. Second, educational material regarding the importance of exercise for physical and mental health in patients with PCa was produced and distributed to patients in the intervention arm of this study. The vast majority of men with advanced PCa on ADT did not meet the general recommendations for exercise intensity and frequency. Therefore, an educational package containing information on the adverse effects of ADT and how exercise can alleviate such symptoms were distributed. Third, to maximize exercise motivation, text messages with information on the importance of exercise were sent every 2 days during intervention. The text messages were developed based on a self-determination motivational theory. It has been suggested that support of patient autonomy, such as providing adequate information and encouragement/support from health professionals, can help motivate and maintain human behavior. Our structured lifestyle intervention program improved QoL and reduced depression in men with PCa on long-term ADT, and its beneficial effects were maintained after withdrawal of intervention. Depression and anxiety are the most common psychological morbidities experienced by cancer survivors. For patients with PCa, such conditions maybe aggravated by long-term ADT, resulting in poorer treatment outcomes, increased hospital stays, and higher mortality rates. Exercise promotes positive metabolic effects by triggering anabolism and stimulating physiological changes in multiorgan systems. In patients with PCa, early exercise intervention has been shown to improve QoL components, including psychological distress. However, due to the uncertain outcomes of interventional studies resulting from the absence of an evidence-based recommendation for exercise intervention, until recently, supervised exercise programs were not acknowledged as routine management for patients on ADT. Our lifestyle intervention program was developed based on the hypothesis that a physician-driven recommendation may trigger the decision-making process to start and maintain an exercise program and ultimately improve mental health-related outcomes. We believe the key to our positive results can be attributed to our use of physician-driven multimodal interventions, including individually tailored exercise feedback based on self-reported diary, accelerometer-monitored measurements, and text messaging.\nA noteworthy observation of our study was that the intervention failed to improve the frequency or intensity of device-measured PA parameters, but improved QoL was nonetheless reported among study participants. There maybe several explanations for this finding. A substantial proportion of our participants had axial bone metastases, and they refrained from vigorous PA and weight-bearing exercise. The maintenance of PA to a light-tomoderate degree in these patients may have affected comparative accelerometer-based parameters between the study groups. Moreover, 33% of the participants had ECOG performance status of greater than one, which may have served as a hindrance to a significant increase in moderate-to-vigorous PA.\nOur study had several limitations. First, the small number of participants and PA data using accelerometers may have limited meaningful analyses, and the results might be different with a larger number of participants. In addition, patients were enrolled from a single center, which may not justify the generalizability of our results. Second, all participants had a stable disease status over the study period. The beneficial effect of the lifestyle intervention program reported in our study participants may not apply to patients with progressive or debilitating disease. Third, a longer interval to maintenance visit is warranted to confirm the effect of our intervention program on long-term QoL. Fourth, the results from self-reported PA and SB may have underestimated the time spent in SB and overestimated the time and degree of PA. Nevertheless, we believe that this effect is inherent in any self-reported results, which led us to use objective accelerometry measurements. Lastly, the cost-effectiveness of such interventions should be investigated to determine their place in routine care. Nevertheless, our results add evidence to the literature indicating that physician-driven intervention in any form has the potential to improve psychological health in patients receiving ADT.\nA physician-driven, structured lifestyle intervention program should be offered, whenever indicated, to patients on ADT due to its inherent advantage related to reducing anxiety and depression. Further research is warranted to investigate the therapeutic contents and concepts for an optimal intervention program for these patients.\n",
