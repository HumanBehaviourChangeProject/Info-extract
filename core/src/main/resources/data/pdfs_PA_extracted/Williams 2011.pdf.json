Since that time, prevalence rates for regular MVPA have not improved, but there have been increases in rates of chronic diseases tied to sedentary behavior (U.S. Department of.\nNumerous physical activity interventions have been tested in an attempt to identify one or more efficacious approaches with the potential for widescale dissemination and public health impact. Among those interventions, non-face-to-face programs may have the greatest potential impact given their capability for broad reach and high efficacy at a relatively low cost.\nA growing subset of non-face-to-face interventions have employed individual tailoring strategies based on theoretical variables previously shown to predict exercise behavior. Individually tailored, print-based interventions have generally been more effective than nontailored interventions across a range of health behavior domains, as evidenced by a recent meta-analysis of 57 studies. The meta-analysis further indicated that intervention efficacy increased when individual tailoring was theory-based and when more theoretical constructs were used for individual tailoring, although there were diminishing returns when tailoring was based on six or more constructs. In addition, among theoretical constructs used in multiple studies, social support had the greatest impact on program efficacy.\nIna study published subsequent to Noar and colleagues' () meta-analysis, we tested a print-based, individually tailored physical activity promotion program among healthy, previously sedentary adults. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: individually tailored physical activity promotion delivered through print or through telephone or a print-based wellness contact control. The two physical activity promotion programs differed with respect to delivery medium (print vs. telephone) but were matched for program content, which was tailored based on five theoretical constructs associated with the transtheoretical model (TTM; i.e., stage of change, decisional balance, behavioral and cognitive processes of change; and socialcognitive theory (SCT; i.e., self-efficacy; Bandura, 1997) using a computerized expert system. At the end of the intervention (Month 12), participants in the print condition reported engaging in more MVPA than participants in the telephone and contact control conditions. Specifically, using an intent-to-treat criterion that assumed no change from baseline physical activity levels among subjects lost to follow-up, print-arm participants increased min/ week of MVPA from a mean of 20.2 (SD ϭ 24.1) at baseline to a mean of 162.4 (SD ϭ 165.2) at Month 12, with approximately 50% reaching national guidelines of at least 150 min/week at study end.\nAlthough superior to the contact control condition, the outcomes from our previous print-based intervention left room for improvement, as only half of the participants reached the program goal. Thus, in the present study, we compared our previous print intervention with an enhanced version, with individual tailoring based on 10 theoretical constructs: five constructs from the original print-based program, plus the additional social-cognitive constructs of social support, outcome expectancies, planning, goal setting, and physical activity enjoyment. We hypothesized that a greater proportion of participants who received the enhanced intervention would reach 150 min/week of MVPA than participants receiving the original intervention. We also hypothesized that participants given the enhanced intervention, versus those given the original intervention, would exhibit greater changes in the additional motivational constructs targeted in the enhanced intervention. We did not include a true control group or a nontailored comparison group, as the critical task was to identify not merely whether tailoring strategies are effective but which tailoring strategies work best.\n",

Participants in both treatment conditions were instructed that their goal was to increase their MVPA to a level that met or exceeded national recommendations (150 min/ week of MVPA;. Randomization was performed following all baseline assessments. To ensure balance across gender and baseline stage of change, an urn randomization sequence was generated by the study statistician and used by the research assistant to assign participants to the two study arms.\nParticipants received a brief orientation at baseline, which included approximately 10 min of face-to-face physical activity goal setting. Print-based intervention materials received by participants in both treatment arms at Months 1-6, 8, 10, and 12 included (a) individually tailored expert system reports, (b) physical activity manuals targeted to participants' physical activity stage of change, and (c) nontailored tip sheets with generic physical activity information (e.g., exercising in bad weather, stretching, local walking malls and parks). Indi-vidual tailoring within the expert system reports was based on questionnaires that were sent, completed, and returned by each participant via mail approximately 2 weeks prior to the mailing of each report. When questionnaires were not returned, subsequent mailings included only nontailored information (i.e., tip sheets). All participants were assessed on all 10 psychosocial constructs used to tailor the enhanced print expert system report. Stage of change was used to determine which of the theoretical constructs were used to tailor the individualized feedback reports, and thus was considered an indicator of program progress rather than a putative mechanism of the intervention.\nParticipants in the enhanced print condition received additional tailoring of feedback reports based on the five constructs added to the enhanced expert system (outcome expectancies, planning, goal setting, social support, and enjoyment). Enhanced print participants also received additional intervention components (see Figure) designed to enhance self-monitoring, modeling, and social support through nontailored means. These components included an additional 10-min face-to-face goal-setting session conducted at the end of the Month 6 assessment session; a mailed goal-setting sheet at Month 9; a physical activity newsletter sent with each print mailing providing additional information on overcoming common barriers and indicating average min/week of MVPA among all participants enrolled in the enhanced print condition; pedometers to encourage greater self-monitoring; and a 5-min video (provided at baseline) modeling a physically active lifestyle. Despite these additional treatment components, participants in both treatment conditions received the same number of in-person and print-based contacts, with the exception of the additional mailed goal-setting sheet at Month 9 for participants in the enhanced print condition.\n",

Longitudinal physical activity outcomes were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE), as implemented in the Correlated Data library of Splus 8.2 (Insightful Corporation, Seattle, WA). Binary physical activity outcomes (i.e., achieving 150 min/week of MVPA) were regressed on baseline min/week of MVPA, time, treatment arm, and baseline psychosocial and sociodemographic characteristics of study participants using binomial errors and a logit link function. Given the longitudinal nature of the study, time-varying effects of baseline covariates were examined as well using forward selection. To maintain comparability with study findings from our earlier physical activity intervention, we forced gender and seasonal effects into the model, irrespective of statistical significance. A working exchangeable correlation matrix was used to accommodate within-subject correlation across time, with robust standard errors used to calculate statistical significance levels.\nContinuous variables were standardized by subtracting off their baseline mean and dividing by their baseline standard deviation based on values from Table. Because baseline physical activity had its range constrained to 0 -90 min/week by study eligibility requirements, we chose to scale MVPA by the 15-min distance separating a person completely sedentary at baseline (MVPA ϭ 0) from the average study enrollee (MVPA ϭ 15). Study group was coded as a binary indicator with the print arm as the reference group (print ϭ 0, enhanced ϭ 1). Time was coded as 0, 1, respectively, at the Month 6 and Month 12 follow-ups. Season at the time of follow-up measures was coded using three binary indicators that contrasted each season with the spring. Gender was coded as a binary indicator (female ϭ 0, male ϭ 1). Model output is shown in Table.\nInterpretation of regression coefficients: Odds ratio to rate ratio conversion. In this model parameterization, the intercept represents odds for achieving 150 min/week MVPA among a reference group of female, employed study participants who reached Month 6 during the spring quarter and reported average values of continuous covariates at baseline (e.g., 15 min/week MVPA). Terms involving time represent either change in odds of achieving 150 min/week MVPA between the Month 6 and Month 12 followups (main effect of time) or time-varying effects of baseline covariates on the odds of achieving 150 min/week MVPA during the 12-month study period (time by covariate interactions).\nIn the absence of treatment by baseline covariate interactions the effect of study group in the odds ratio scale does not depend on the values chosen for the other model covariates and is, therefore, a simple-to-convey summary of the overall treatment effect that applies equally well to all study participants. However, because most people find it easier to think in terms of percentages rather than odds, odds ratios (ORs) are often misinterpreted as rate ratios (RRs; i.e., a doubling of the odds of achieving 150 min/week MVPA for participants assigned to enhanced print rather than standard print maybe assumed to imply that twice as many participants are likely to achieve 150 min/week MVPA in the enhanced print as in the standard print condition). Given that the success rate in the standard print arm was quite high, the treatment OR tends to exceed the corresponding RR and may lead to overoptimistic conclusions about the potential impact of the intervention. A perhaps more readily interpretable assessment of intervention effects can be obtained by converting the regression-adjusted odds of achieving 150 min/week MVPA in each study arm to the probability scale and using these as the basis of RR calculations. Because these calculations depend on the entire set of model covariates included in the logistic regression model (e.g., gender, season, etc.), we chose to limit them to the representative reference group of study participants described above (female, employed, reached Month 6 during the spring quarter, reported average values of continuous covariates at baseline).\nExploratory linear regression for min/week of MVPA at 6and 12-month follow-ups.\nParallel analyses of continuous physical activity outcomes (i.e., min/week of MVPA as measured by the PAR) were conducted using random-intercept normal linear regression models.\nBetween-groups differences in psychosocial variables used to tailor the intervention.

The results showed that, when controlling for covariates, participants in the enhanced print condition had 46% and 50% greater odds of achieving 150 min/week of MVPA at the Month 6 and Month 12 follow-ups, respectively. These results, however, were not statistically significant. Analysis of continuous outcomes (i.e., min/ week of MVPA) showed a time by treatment interaction indicating that from Month 6 to Month 12, MVPA leveled off in the enhanced print condition but decreased significantly in the print condition. Taken together, these results suggest that additional tailoring based on SCT variables resulted in a slightly greater proportion of participants achieving physical activity recommendations than tailoring based mostly on the TTM, but that this difference was not as great as we had hoped when we powered the trial.\nIt should be noted that participants in our initial trial receiving the same print intervention as in the present trial reached 40% and 50% success rates for achieving 150 min/week of MVPA at Month 6 and Month 12, respectively, using a baseline-value-carriedforward approach to missing outcome data. Therefore, under an assumption of 10% dropout at each follow-up, success rates among study completers in the print condition of the present study were anticipated to reach 44% at Month 6 and 63% at Month 12. We powered the present study to detect an 18% increase in success rates among enhanced print study completers to 62% at Month 6 and 81% at Month 12. However, in the present study, the unadjusted rates of achieving 150 min/week of MVPA among study completers at Month 6 were 35% in the print condition versus 42% in the enhanced print condition, resulting in a 7% difference in success rates across study conditions that was considerably smaller than expected. Furthermore, success rates in the two study conditions declined at Month 12 to 29% and 35%, respectively, instead of showing the anticipated increases seen in the previous trial (see Figure).\nDifferences in sample characteristics may have contributed to these decreases in absolute levels of program success. First, a greater percentage of participants in the present trial, relative to our previous trial, were completely sedentary at baseline (64.5% vs. 51.5%). Participants who reported some MVPA at baseline (15 min/week) were more likely to achieve 150 min/week of MVPA at follow-up, particularly at Month 12 (44% increased odds), relative to participants who were completely sedentary at baseline. Thus, having a greater proportion of completely sedentary participants in the present trial may have contributed to the lower overall success in achieving the program goal. Second, a greater proportion of participants were from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds in the present trial relative to our previous trial, and minority status is inversely related to physical activity levels in national samples (Centers for Disease. With respect to changes in the targeted theoretical constructs, we did not hypothesize differential change in self-efficacy, decisional balance, or cognitive and behavioral processes of change given that these constructs were targeted in both treatment conditions. As expected, social support from friends showed significant increases in the enhanced print condition relative to the print condition at Months 6 and 12. Given the apparent importance of social support based on a recent meta-analysis of individually tailored health behavior interventions, it is possible that the successful targeting of this variable may have led to the trend for physical activity outcomes in favor of the enhanced print condition.\nThe lack of treatment effects on other theoretical constructs maybe the result of conceptual overlap among the constructs targeted in both conditions (self-efficacy, decisional balance, cognitive and behavioral processes of change) and those targeted in just the enhanced print condition (outcome expectancies, enjoyment, goals, planning, and social support). As suggested by, such conceptual overlap among theoretical constructs may lead to diminishing returns when tailoring is based on a large number of theoretical constructs. For example, in the present study, intervention components designed to impact decisional balance (i.e., pros and cons of regular physical activity) may have also impacted outcome expectancies given the conceptual overlap between these constructs.\n",

Theoretically, findings that trend in favor of hypotheses but do not achieve statistical significance can always be attributed to alack of power; however, the results in the present study appear to be clinically meaningful, as the odds of achieving 150 min/week of MVPA were increased by approximately 50% for participants in the enhanced print condition relative to the print condition. Moreover, although a weaker comparison condition (e.g., wait-list or contact control) would undoubtedly have resulted in \"stronger effects\" for treatment, by using a strong comparison condition, we were able to address questions about how tailored interventions work (i.e., the added value of tailoring on additional socialcognitive constructs) rather than just whether our particular intervention helps increase MVPA.\nA second limitation is that our analysis of treatment effects on the targeted theoretical constructs provides only a snapshot of the process through which the enhanced intervention may have impacted physical activity behavior. We did not present a full mediation analysis, as considerable additional space is necessary to discuss appropriate statistical modeling of the joint and independent mediation effects of the putative mediators, as assessed at multiple time points.\nA third limitation of this study is that our sample may not generalize to other types of adult populations. Although we recruited more minority individuals than in our previous trial, our sample consisted of mostly women who were highly educated, within a certain age group, and of high socioeconomic status.

      "value": "An enhanced print-based physical activity promotion program tailored on theoretical constructs from the TTM and SCT resulted in roughly 50% greater odds of achieving national guidelines for physical activity than a similar program tailored on fewer theoretical constructs. Social support was the only theoretical construct that showed greater increases among participants in the enhanced program and may account for the differences in physical activity outcomes, although further (mediation) analysis is necessary.\nAlthough a formal cost analysis is beyond the scope of this article, review of monetary expenditures clearly indicates that the additional cost of the enhanced program consisted mainly of development costs. These costs of developing the algorithm for the additional print-based content and associated programming were significant in terms of investigator and staff compensation. However, once intervention development was complete, the differential delivery costs between the enhanced print and print interventions were minimal. That is, with the exception of the cost of the physical activity videos (approximately $12 per video) provided at baseline, the pedometers (approximately $10 per pedometer), and the printing costs of the newsletter, the cost to deliver the two programs was virtually identical (for a similar cost analysis, see.\nThus, in light of the marginal relative efficacy of the enhanced program in the present study, we conclude that enhanced tailoring (e.g., doubling of tailored constructs) of existing individually tailored behavior change programs maybe worthwhile to the extent that there is ultimately a large intended audience for the program, as there is little added delivery cost per additional participant. However, when intended audiences are small, the marginal increases in efficacy, based on findings from the present study, may not be worth the substantial development costs associated with enhanced tailoring.\n",
