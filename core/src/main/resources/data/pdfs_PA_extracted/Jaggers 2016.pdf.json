      "value": "With the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) extending the life of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), there has emerged an aging HIV population and the long term consequences associated with ART toxicity. These consequences primarily affect metabolic processes often resulting in conditions similar to that of metabolic syndrome. 1,2 For example, protease inhibitors have been shown to increase circulating blood lipids (i.e. triglycerides, cholesterol, etc.) and cause a pattern of abnormal fat deposition known as lipodystrophy -ABSTRACT Background: The purpose of this investigation was to test the feasibility of a home-based moderate-intensity physical activity (MPA) program for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) currently taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods: participants recruited fora 9-month home-based PA intervention aimed to reduce risk factors of cardiovascular disease for PLWHA taking ART. All participants received an educational weight loss workbook and a pedometer for self-monitoring of physical activity. The intervention group received elastic Therabands速 for strength training in addition to telephone based behavioural coaching. Clinical assessments were conducted at baseline and each follow-up which also included psychometric questionnaires and PA levels via the SenseWear速 armband accelerometer. Results: Of the 57 completing the study, 29 of those were in the intervention group and 28 were in the standard care group. Results show that the home-based PA intervention was not successful in increasing the total amount of MPA for PLWHA. However there was a trend (p=0.08) of decreasing sedentary time. Ina secondary analysis those who increased PA by >10% observed decreases in waist circumference and improved functioning at 18 weeks. None of the changes observed were significant after controlling for all potential confounders. Conclusions: A home-based exercise approach with telephone-based coaching may not be a feasible method for increasing MPA among PLWHA. Slight decreases in sedentary time indicate some positive changes in activity habits. A possible strategy to improve studies similar to this is to incorporate a group based social interaction each week similar to that of a support group.",

      "value": "resulting in central fat accumulation. Other classes of antiretrovirals are known to cause gastrointestinal and metabolic consequences. Evidence has shown that the risk for cardiovascular and diabetes related complications increases significantly for every year a person is taking ART. Physical activity has been widely accepted as away to reduce the incidence and risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in the general population as well as PLWHA. Physical activity is especially important to PLWHA because the side effects associated with ART can have a synergistic effect on lifestyle choices such as sedentary living, unhealthy diets, and other determinants of chronic disease. Routine physical activity could be successful in reducing some of the side effects of HIV infection/treatment and help self-manage the disease while improving quality of life.\nRoutine physical activity has proven benefits in general and clinical populations. Many of the physiological benefits of activity area direct result of metabolic improvements (i.e. improved lipid panel, reduced waist circumference and body fat, etc.) with long-term improvements in cardiorespiratory health. Randomized controlled trials of physical activity interventions have shown decreases in body weight and visceral fat accumulation, increased HDL cholesterol, decreased triglycerides, and improved insulin sensitivity. These studies are of various lengths with some lasting as little as 6-8 weeks and others showing benefits from year-long interventions. What is unclear, however, is whether PLWHA on ART intervention will benefit similarly from a physical activity intervention. Because the rate of HIV infection continues to increase in low-income populations, it is important that cost-effective interventions aimed at increasing physical activity are identified and implemented. The increased number of barriers to physical activity among many PLWHA requires the development of effective interventions that can be provided to large numbers at a low cost.\nA number of studies demonstrate the effectiveness of community-based physical activity interventions. These interventions range from group-based classroom activities that emphasize behavior modification and education all the way to simple home-based approaches that incorporate weekly or bi-weekly telephone calls from a trained health educator. These strategies have been shown to be effective in a range of populations. Similar home-based activity programs have targeted healthy populations as well as a variety of clinical populations such as those with heart failure, cancer, sporadic inclusion body myositis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and outcomes associated with various inflammatory responses. To date, there have been no published investigations that incorporate a homebased exercise approach for PLWHA.\nThere is a growing body of evidence suggesting plwha can achieve similar benefits in routine physical activity commonly observed in the general population. The use of a home-based physical activity intervention in other clinical populations has successfully increased the amount of daily physical activity accumulated when compared to a control group. These programs incorporated moderate-intensity physical activity, which has been shown to be safe for clinical populations with functional limitations. Similar physical activity interventions are needed that can improve selfmanagement of metabolic conditions among PLWHA taking art. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a home-based physical activity intervention aimed to increase moderate intensity physical activity and reduce the incidence of cardiometabolic risk factors among PLWHA.\n",

This measurement was used as an index of program adherence and total accumulation of daily physical activity. Using tri-accelerometry technology augmented by 2 heat sensors (a thermistorbased skin surface sensor and a proprietary heat flux sensor), and a galvanic skin response sensor, the device is able to accurately measure and record total energy expenditure, and also measures activity intensity. The 4 internal sensors turn on the monitor when detecting skin contact and measures total time the armband was worn, daily energy expenditure, step count, sleep efficiency, and the intensity, duration, and frequency of physical activity bouts.\nAll armband data were analyzed by computer-based software using demographic information (gender, age, height, and weight at prior assessment) and proprietary algorithms. Validity of armband energy expenditure estimates has been reported in several conditions including resting, exercise (i.e. treadmill and cycle ergometer), and free-living conditions (i.e. physical activity and exercise). St-Onge et al. found that when comparing the armband to doubly labeled water daily energy expenditure had an interclass correlation of 0.81 (P < 0.01) between the two methods. When comparing the armband to the Intelligent Device for Estimating Energy Expenditure and Activity (IDEEA) Welk et al. showed comparable results between the armband and IDEEA when estimating energy expenditure and PA. Participants were required to wear the armband fora minimum of 10 hours on 4 separate days for the armband data to be considered valid. Secondary outcomes included physiological and psychological variables, such as cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2), body composition, full blood lipid panel, serum C -reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), depression, anxiety, stress, and health-related quality of life.\n",

All participants were currently taking a combination antiretroviral regimen and none reported changes in medications throughout the study duration. The majority of participants (54%) were females and African-American (82%), with a self-reported income less than $30,000 (69%). The average age was 47.1賊9.4 years. Table shows the baseline values of each outcome variable.

Those who increased their activity levels by 10% or more showed a decreasing trend in waist circumference that barely reached significance (p = 0.05) at the 18 week time point, but not 36 weeks. Systolic blood pressure also significantly decreased (p = 0.023) for those who increased their daily physical activity at 18 weeks, but no difference was observed at 36 weeks.

Another possible explanation for the conflicting results could be the population itself. PLWHA are known to have inconsistent periods of good and bad health. Depression and anxiety are also very common when faced with a chronic condition like HIV making it that much harder to be active consistently. In the study by Matthews and colleagues they recruited survivors of breast cancer. The women in that investigation were possibly more focused on improving their health and quality of life since they had just overcome a life threatening condition such as cancer.\n",

This was done in an effort to test the effects of increased activity particularly on markers of cardio-metabolic risk. What we found were significant changes in two variables, both of which are known risk factors for CVD. More specifically, those who increased daily physical activity saw a decrease in waist circumference and systolic blood pressure. Although not significant, some individuals experienced improved lipid profiles, such as increased HDL cholesterol and decreased LDL cholesterol. These findings are similar to what would be expected among healthy individuals and would further indicate the importance to identify simple and cost-effective interventions that successfully increase physical activity among PLWHA.\nAs presented in Table.1, there was a slight downward trend at 18 weeks inmost of the psychological variables, including physical functioning, physical and emotional health, energy/fatigue, mental and social health, pain, and general health. At 36 weeks, a stronger downward trend was observed for pain and emotional health; however physical functioning, mental and social health, energy/fatigue, and general health did not show significant change. None of the changes observed were significant after controlling for all potential confounders. Various factors could have contributed to this lack of significance. For example the length of time between questionnaires and characteristics of the population are possible reasons. The participants completed the profile of mood states questionnaire a total of 3 times: baseline, weeks, and 36 weeks. To observe a true relationship, this should be completed multiple times throughout the week and studied using an average of those results. Other researchers have observed a trend between pain and mood with exercise. Neidig et al saw a decrease in depressive symptoms in HIV infected individuals after a 12 week exercise intervention using the CES-D and POMS depression subscale. This group is known to have multiple comorbidities, side effects to medications, socioeconomic barriers, and psychosocial concerns.\nA possible strategy to improve studies similar to this is to incorporate a group based social interaction each week similar to that of a support group. It also would be ideal to include a type of \"buddy system\" or asking participants to recruit a partner to exercise with them. Studies have consistently shown the importance of social support among physical activity and the social interaction will often increase the chances of success when someone is beginning anew workout program. Many of the participants of this trial actually asked if such a system was in place. Since this was a single-person study design, it was explained to them that being paired with a partner was not part of the study protocol, but it was encouraged that they find a friend or loved one who might be able to exercise with them.\nOne of the most significant findings of this study was further evidence showing a strong inverse relationship between waist circumference and increased physical activity. Ina previous article from this study, we showed moderate intensity physical activity to be a significant predictor for waist circumference. Although the intervention itself was not successful in increasing physical activity, when the sample was divided into groups according to changes in physical activity, the data showed that regardless of group assignment those who significantly increased their daily physical activity significantly decreased their waist circumference at the week time point.\nStrengths and limitations of the current study should betaken into careful consideration and may explain some of our findings, or lack thereof. The strengths included recruiting an HIV population with almost equal numbers of males and females, which allowed for comparing possible gender differences of significant findings. It should also be noted that this clinical trial incorporated a randomized design of physically inactive HIV+ patients and an analysis plan that utilized intent-to-treat principles. When separated into groups according to change in physical activity, it was observed that health benefits could be obtained within 18 weeks for this specific population. In addition to a randomized design, this study also incorporated objective measures of physical activity and sedentary behavior using the Sensewear速 armband.\nSeveral limitations should be noted as well. This population was comprised primarily of African-Americans from lower socio-economic status and majority reported a yearly income less than $30,000. This does not allow us to generalize the findings across other races or individuals living with HIV with a higher yearly income who may have access to other means for physical activity such as gyms or home exercise equipment.\nAlthough this investigation examined numerous confounding variables, the lack of unmeasured covariates cannot be ruled out. Some of these include weekly, or even daily, health status and dietary intake. Another covariate could potentially be chronic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy which is very common among PLWHA and known to limit activity levels. Other limitations include the lack of dietary data and exercise log to determine weekly adherence.\n",

With increases in life expectancy due to the advances in treating HIV, daily physical activity is an important step in helping PLWHA self-manage the detrimental side effects often associated with pharmacological treatment, as well reduce the risk of developing chronic comorbid conditions such as CVD and diabetes. Since the antiretroviral regimen has because a necessity to halt viral replication it is critical that we discover better ways to improve the long term health for those living with HIV. Daily activity has shown promising results in other clinical populations, but with limited evidence among the HIV population. Additional research is needed to not only test the hypothesis that long term changes in physical activity behaviors would improve quality of life by helping self-manage the illness, but also to discover more cost-effective and practical ways to achieve this lifestyle change. With increased rates of new infections occurring in more rural areas and those of lower socioeconomic status it is imperative that community-based programs tailored to these individuals are developed. Such programs will not be possible without first increasing efforts of bridging clinical-community linkages that in turn could help improve enrollment, adherence, retention, etc.\n",
