      "value": "ABSTRACT Background Adolescence is a recognised period of physical activity decline, particularly among low-income communities. We report the 12-month (midpoint) effects of a 2-year multicomponent physical activity intervention implemented in disadvantaged secondary schools. Methods A cluster randomised trial was undertaken in 10 secondary schools located in disadvantaged areas in New South Wales, Australia. Students in Grade 7 were recruited, with follow-up in Grade 8. The intervention was guided by socioecological theory and included seven physical activity strategies, and six implementation adoption strategies. The primary outcome was mean minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day assessed using Actigraph GT3X accelerometers. Outcome data were analysed using repeated measures linear mixed models. Results At baseline, 1150 (93%) students participated in the data collection (mean age 12 years, 48% boys) and 1050 (79%) students participated at 12-month follow-up. By the 12-month follow-up, the six implementation adoption strategies had been used to support schools to deliver four of the seven physical activity elements. There was a significant group-by-time interaction for mean minutes of MVPA per day in favour of the intervention group (adjusted difference between groups at follow-up=3.85 min, 95% CI (0.79 to 6.91), p≤0.01), including significantly more vigorous physical activity (2.45 min, p≤0.01), equating to 27 min more MVPA per week. Summary At 12-month follow-up, the intervention had reduced the decline in physical activity among adolescents from disadvantaged schools. The intervention may assist students to meet physical activity guidelines.\n",

      "value": "Participation in adequate physical activity has numerous physical and psychological health benefits. 1 Despite this, the proportion of adolescents who are adequately active is consistently low, with as few as 20% meeting physical activity guidelines of 60 min MVPA per day. International data indicate a significant inverse association between physical activity and socioeconomic status (SES), with adolescents from disadvantaged backgrounds experiencing a steeper decline in physical activity. As physical inactivity tends to track into adulthood, reducing this decline is a public health priority. Schools provide access to almost all adolescents over extended periods of time. Schools have qualified staff such as physical education (PE) teachers, resources including sporting equipment and facilities, and a mandate to implement curriculum that promotes physical activity. Based on a number of systematic reviews, there is evidence that school-based interventions are effective in increasing the proportion of students who are physically active, the length of time spent being active, and student fitness levels. However, such evidence is primarily focused on children of elementary school age (5-12 years), with very few studies focusing on adolescents. Systematic reviews of physical activity interventions for children and adolescents conclude that interventions were more likely to be successful if they were multicomponent, longer in duration and based on theory. 10 Such reviews recommended that future trials include the use of an objective measure of physical activity, measurement of total daily physical activity, use clear intervention implementation strategies, focus on low-socioeconomic groups, focus on interventions targeting adolescents, have an intervention duration spanning greater than 12 months, and employ longer follow-up.\nOf the fourteen interventions targeting schoolbased physical activity in adolescents, only five studies have specifically targeted disadvantaged secondary school students. Of these, three have tested single sex interventions, and the studies did not demonstrate a positive intervention effect on physical activity. The two remaining intervention trials both used an objective measure of physical activity and were able to demonstrate an intervention effect. However, both interventions were of short duration, weeks and 6 months, respectively. Given the limited number of effective interventions targeting greater physical activity among adolescents from disadvantaged backgrounds, the primary aim of this study was to report on the 12-month, mid-intervention impact of a 2-year multicomponent physical activity intervention implemented in disadvantaged secondary schools, which aimed to reduce the decline in physical activity associated with adolescence. Subgroup analyses for sex, baseline weight status and baseline activity level are also reported.\n",

The strategies implemented in the intervention addressed the domains of the WHO's Health Promoting Schools framework targeting the curriculum, school environment and community. The intervention comprised seven physical activity strategies to be implemented in a staged fashion over the intervention period (see figure for strategies and the standards set to be achieved for each). The strategies were: 'Formal Curriculum'-(1) teaching strategies to maximise activity in PE lessons, including pedometer-based lessons, (2) development of individual student physical activity plans, (3) enhanced school sport for all students (to be delivered in Grade (8); 'School Ethos and Environment'-(4) school physical activity policies, (5) offering physical activity in school breaks (lunch and recess); 'Partnerships and Services'-(6) linking schools to community physical activity providers, (7) parent engagement. By 12-month follow-up, implementation duration within intervention schools ranged from two to three school terms (each term was 10 weeks in duration). Implementation of four of the seven physical activity strategies started (strategies 1, 2, 5, 7 above).\nFigure summarises the physical activity strategies delivered, the adoption strategies used to facilitate their delivery and the desired standard and dose delivered within the first 12 months of the intervention period. In the first 12-month period, two curriculum-based strategies started, including teaching strategies to maximise activity in PE and the development of individualised student physical activity plans. To facilitate adoption, PE teachers were provided training on strategies to maximise physical activity in PE, prompted by the change agent to teach pedometer-based lessons and support students to complete personalised physical activity plans, were given resources (such as templates and instructions for use) to support students in developing personal activity plans, and given feedback on activity levels in PE based on SOFIT observations. One strategy targeting the school ethos and environment started within the first 12-month period. Offering physical activity in school breaks (lunch and/or recess) started in each school twice per week. Schools were provided equipment, including a variety of balls, hoops and ropes in a secure locked box to facilitate the start of these activities. The final strategy to start within the first 12-month period focused on parent engagement, whereby hard copy newsletters and websites were used to provide parents with updates in the programme being implemented at school plus articles about ways to support students to be active outside of the school. To facilitate the adoption of these physical activity strategies, schools established committees to oversee the changes and were provided with feedback reports outlining the schools progress towards programme adoption at the end of each term. Meetings were held with school executives, PE teachers and the school change agent to communicate the content of each feedback report.\n",

The school change agent records showed that all schools had started use of the pedometers in PE classes, with four of the five schools (80%) using them with the desired frequency (figure). Similarly, while all schools had administered student physical activity plans at least once, three (60%) had administered these as per the desired termly standard (2 or 3 per student).

At 12-month follow-up, students attending intervention schools participated in nearly 4 min more MVPA per day than control group students. To some readers, this may not sound like a clinically meaningful difference. However, it represents 27 min more of MVPA over the course of a week.\nSmall, but clinically significant effect at 1 year Research in children and adolescents has identified a doseresponse relationship between the total volume of MVPA and a reduction in cardiometabolic risk; therefore, any increase in MVPA has public health benefit. Students in the intervention group participated in significantly more vigorous activity and spent a greater proportion of time in MVPA and vigorous activity each day. We suggest that this magnitude of change in physical activity, particularly the increase in vigorous activity, is clinically meaningful, and may facilitate the prevention of chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. The results displayed at 12 months extend the results described in a meta-analysis of physical activity interventions in children and adolescents; 51 however, most interventions focus on children and few on adolescents. As a result, the effect size seems larger than other school-based interventions targeting adolescents. Of the interventions targeting adolescents that have been effective, two studies published midintervention findings, both of which showed no significant intervention effect. Other school-based interventions targeting adolescents demonstrated positive postintervention findings in favour of the intervention group, with effect sizes  More recently, three interventions have specifically targeted adolescents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds; however, none have shown a significant intervention effect on MVPA.

Including explicit implementation strategies, as recommended in systematic reviews, may explain our positive findings.\nIn particular, the change agent, someone located within the school 1 day per week to support schools in implementing the physical activity strategies (not to deliver them) is novel. Schools often report time and demanding workloads as barriers to implementing intervention strategies. The addition of a change agent aims to overcome these barriers, and maximise intervention reach and fidelity. The addition of a further three physical activity strategies to the PA4E1 intervention in the second phase of intervention, may enhance the likelihood of sustained success.

These results are in contrast to a systematic review by Yildirim finding girls responded better to interventions than boys. If our midpoint assessment holds true, it would have heath implications as female students who participate in less MVPA per day are less likely to achieve the daily physical activity guidelines and reduce their activity throughout adolescence at a faster rate. Although programme records showed that recess and lunch activities were offered in all intervention schools, girls were less likely to report that their school offered organised recess and lunchtime physical activities compared to boys; a substantial proportion of both sexes were not aware of the activities. As physical activity during recess and lunch has been reported to contribute as much as 40% towards daily physical activity recommendations, the introduction of recess and lunchtime activities that are more evident to students, especially those that appeal to girls, seems an important consideration for future research.

This decrease, however, seems consistent with other studies for this target group. Lubans et al 62 found that although 79% to 85% of the baseline sample was retained after 12 months, only 53.5% of the sample of disadvantaged girls provided three or more days of valid accelerometer data. Similarly, only 64% of students in the HEIA study in Norway provided useable accelerometer data at the 20-month postintervention. Although accelerometers are considered the optimal method for measuring physical activity, compliance to protocols among the students, particularly disadvantaged students, has been documented as a challenge.
