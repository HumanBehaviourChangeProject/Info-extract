Design Multicentre trial with participants randomised to usual ERS alone (control) or usual ERS plus e-coachER (intervention). Setting Primary care and ERS in three UK sites from 2015 to 2018. Participants 450 inactive ERS referees with chronic health conditions. Interventions Participants received a pedometer, PA recording sheets and a user guide for the web-based support. e-coachER interactively encouraged the use of the ERS and other PA options. Main outcome measures Primary and key secondary outcomes were: objective moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) minutes (in ≥10 min bouts and without bouts), respectively, after 12 months. Secondary outcomes were: other accelerometer-derived and self-reported PA measures, ERS attendance, EQ-5D-5L, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and beliefs about PA. All outcomes were collected at baseline, 4 and 12 months. Primary analysis was an intention to treat comparison between intervention and control arms at 12-month follow-up. Results There was no significant effect of the intervention on weekly MVPA at 12 months between the groups recorded in ≥10 min bouts (mean difference 11.8 min of MVPA, 95% CI: −2.1 to 26.0; p=0.10) or without bouts (mean difference 13.7 min of MVPA, 95% CI: −26.8 to 54.2; p=0.51) for 232 participants with usable data. There was no difference in the primary or secondary PA outcomes at 4 or 12 months. Conclusion Augmenting ERS referrals with web-based behavioural support had only a weak, non-significant effect on MVPA. Trial registration number ISRCTN15644451.",

      "value": "Low levels of physical activity (PA) area significant contributor to a wide range of chronic physical and mental health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis and depression and associated healthcare cost. Primary care exercise referral schemes (ERSs) have small positive effects on self-reported PA, compared with usual care. However, most of these trials are underpowered, and do not necessarily include physically inactive participants with chronic conditions. The format of ERS range from considerable exercise practitioner contact at an exercise facility to a signposting service to community PA options with minimal sustained contact. This variation in ERS makes a broader national approach to improving the quality of the patient experience and effectiveness challenging. Given that only 66%-81% ever attend the referral scheme, that only 43%-49% complete it and that the health benefits seem to be small, new ways are needed to improve uptake and adherence to ERS, and to foster sustainable PA from ERS. Web-based interventions have been shown to be effective in supporting short-term changes in (mostly self-reported) PA among the general population and those with clinical conditions. However, no studies have explored their use alongside ERS offering face-to-face support. Along with service users, we developed a bespoke support system called e-coachER, using the LifeGuide platform (https://www. lifeguideonline. org/), seeking to empower ERS participants with physical and mental health conditions to become more physically active and to remain motivated to do so. If shown to bean effective adjunctive intervention, such a system could be scaled up relatively cheaply and routinely offered to thousands of patients per year in hundreds of schemes in the UK.\nWe undertook a multicentre parallel two-group randomised controlled trial to determine the impact of the addition of web-based behavioural support for ERS referral on PA and health outcomes in inactive people with chronic disease.\n",

The primary analysis compared primary and secondary outcomes between groups in accordance with the principle of intention to treat (ITT) (ie, based on original random allocation) in participants with complete outcomes at 12 months, adjusting for baseline outcome values and stratification and minimisation variables. Following assessment of baseline demographics, mean age and gender were also added to the adjusted model.\nTwo secondary analyses were undertaken to compare groups across all follow-up points using a mixed model repeated measures approach and complier average causal effect (CACE) analyses undertaken to examine the impact of adherence to the intervention, (ie, (a) simply registering to access the website or not and (b) completing five or more 'Steps to Health' or not) on primary and secondary outcomes at 12 months.\nThe primary analysis model was extended to fit interaction terms to explore possible subgroup differences in intervention effect in stratification and minimisation variables for the primary outcome at 12 months.

This has been a challenge for other ERS studies as well involving both device-based and subjectively 26 captured PA; for example, the latter study followed up only 55.6% of participants at 6 months. The e-coachER study was initially powered to detect differences in numbers achieving 150 min of MVPA based on our systematic review. Due to early recruitment issues, the sample size was recalculated as reported, with the primary outcome based on ≥10 min bouts. The scant available data from devicebased assessed PA in comparable trials made the power calculation somewhat uncertain, and we also need to know more about what is a clinically significant change in device-based assessed MVPA to justify sample sizes. Our prespecified analysis plan, involving a measure of MVPA in bouts of ≥10 min, meant that a larger proportion of the sample than expected recorded zero minutes. This required us to explore a number of analysis models for the primary analysis, none of which were ideal but did provide a consistent conclusion. Given that other studies have reported findings using a different accelerometer wear time (eg, Harris et al reported MVPA minutes from 'at least 1 day' to estimate weekly activity we also considered our data with a range of wear time criteria, and again the findings were consistent.\nThe primary focus was on differences in MVPA minutes at 12 months, but both groups showed an increase at 4 months. Our aim was to increase uptake and long-term change in MVPA, given concerns that ERS only foster short-term change, but providing the e-coachER intervention at the same time as what was somewhat effective ERS support may have limited the perceived need for e-coachER engagement. Also, digital support interventions are renowned for having relatively short-term engagement and effects, so it maybe that greater digital support is needed after 4 months (the typical duration of ERS).\nIn line with guidelines for ERS research, we tried to make the intervention as accessible as possible to participants from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, which we achieved to some extent, but with an increasing array of devices for selfmonitoring and setting goals for PA, and it maybe that many participants in both arms of our sample were independently accessing these, which thereby negated any benefits from the e-coachER intervention.\n",

This finding also aligns with recently reported data from the USA, which identified a range of 3.4%-95.6% of people achieving 150 min of MVPA depending on how the accelerometer data were processed. This is important given the recent removal of the '≥10 min bouts' in UK and international guidelines. It has been suggested that data collected using accelerometers is incompatible with guidelines of 150 min of MVPA per week and a value of about 1000 unbouted minutes of MVPA would need to be recommended for public health benefits. Our sample at baseline recorded only 346 min of unbouted weekly MVPA, which highlights the uniqueness of the study involving attempts to support change in such a low active sample, who potentially have the greatest to gain in terms of health from increases in MVPA.\nA final consideration is that there was a small indication of imbalance in educational status between the groups at baseline, with a greater proportion of those with no qualification, and a slightly smaller proportion with higher qualifications, in the control group. However, given the relative small numbers of those in the respective categories for educational status, the fact that we had not specified inclusion of this variable in our statistical analysis plan for the primary analysis, and the absence of between group differences in IT confidence, we chose not to further explore any confounding effects of educational status.\n",
