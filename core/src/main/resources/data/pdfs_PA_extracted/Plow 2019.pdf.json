      "value": "To compare the effectiveness of telephone-delivered interventions on fatigue, physical activity, and quality of life outcomes in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: A single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomized to contact-control intervention (CC), physical activityeonly intervention (PA-only), and physical activity plus fatigue self-management intervention (FMþ). Outcomes were measured at baseline (2wk prerandomization), posttest (14wk postrandomization), and follow-up (26wk postrandomization). Setting: Telephone-delivered in Midwest and Northeast regions of the United States. Participants: Inactive adults with MS (NZ208) and moderate-to-severe fatigue.\nInterventions: Three or 6 group teleconferences followed by 4 individually tailored phone calls delivered during 12 weeks. An occupational therapist and research assistant delivered the teleconferences and tailored phone calls, respectively. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes were self-report fatigue and physical activity measured with the Fatigue Impact Scale and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, respectively. Secondary outcomes included quality of life measured with the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale and moderate-to-vigorous exercise and step count measured with an accelerometer. Results: Linear mixed effects models showed FMþ significantly improved self-reported fatigue (bZÀ11.08; PZ.03) and physical activity (bZ0.54; PZ.01) compared with CC at posttest. However, FMþ had nonsignificant differences compared with PA-only on self-report fatigue (bZÀ1.08, PZ.84) and physical activity (bZ0.09; PZ.68) at posttest. PAeonly had significant improvements compared with CC on moderateto-vigorous exercise (bZ0.38; PZ.02) at posttest and step count at posttest (bZ1.30; P<.01) and follow-up (bZ1.31; PZ.01) measured with an accelerometer. FMþ and PA-only had nonsignificant differences compared with CC on quality of life. Conclusions: Group teleconferences followed by tailored phone calls have a small yet statistically significant effect in promoting physical activity and reducing fatigue impact in people with MS.",

      "value": "Telephone-delivered interventions can enhance quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). These interventions can be designed to promote physical activity, including walking and moderate-to-vigorous exercise, which can improve mental and physical functioning. They can also be designed to promote fatigue self-management behaviors, such as taking rest breaks and modifying activities, which can reduce the impact of fatigue on daily activities. Telephone-delivered interventions may further help to address unmet needs for rehabilitation services in people with MS. Nonetheless, systematic reviews have indicated that more research is needed on the effectiveness of telephonedelivered interventions and the optimal ways to design interventions to promote behavior change. These reviews have reported that a limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted and that physical activity and selfmanagement interventions have modest but significant effects on promoting healthy behaviors and increasing health-related quality of life.\nOne strategy for testing and optimizing telephone-delivered interventions is comparative effectiveness research. This approach can address questions about the relative effectiveness of intervention strategies and how best to promote healthy behaviors. For example, a pertinent question across clinical disciplines is how many types of behaviors an intervention should target for change. If the intervention targets too many behaviors, it may overwhelm participants. Alternatively, if the intervention targets too few behaviors, opportunities maybe missed in achieving synergistic benefits.\nWhether interventions should be designed to promote physical activity and fatigue self-management behaviors independently or simultaneously is a pertinent question to address among people with MS. Previous studies have examined the effects of interventions designed to promote physical activity or fatigue selfmanagement behaviors alone. However, the combined effects of studying both have not yet been examined systematically. Physical activity may address primary and secondary causes of fatigue, whereas fatigue self-management behaviors may reduce barriers to engaging in physical activity and reduce the impact of fatigue on daily activities.\nThis study aimed to compare the effectiveness of telephonedelivered interventions on outcomes of fatigue impact, physical activity, and health-related quality of life. The 12-week interventions were delivered entirely over the telephone via group teleconferences and individually tailored phone calls. Participants with MS were randomized into (1) a contact-control social support intervention (CC); (2) a physical activityeonly intervention (PA-only); (3) a physical activity plus fatigue self-management intervention (FMþ). Our primary hypothesis was that (1) the FMþ intervention would yield statistically significant improvements on the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) at posttest (ie, immediately postintervention) compared with the PA-only and CC interventions. We also explored the following in 3 secondary analyses: (2) the sustained effects of the FMþ interventions at follow-up (ie, 12wk postintervention), (3) the effects of the PAonly intervention compared with CC intervention, and (4) the effects of the PA-only and FMþ interventions on secondary outcomes of health-related quality of life and objectivelymeasured physical activity.\n",

Higher scores indicate greater fatigue impact. The FIS is commonly used to evaluate interventions and is considered reliable and valid in populations with MS. Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire The GLTEQ contains 3 questions about the frequency of engagement in strenuous, moderate, and light leisure-time exercises of at least 15 minutes. To calculate a composite score, strenuous, moderate, and light activities are multiplied by 9, 5, and 3, respectively, and summed. A higher score indicates increased engagement in physical activity. The GLTEQ is commonly used to evaluate physical activity interventions and is reliable and valid in populations with MS. Accelerometers ActiGraph triaxis accelerometers a were used to measure step counts (average steps/d) and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous exercise (average min/d). Participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer for 7 days on an elastic belt around the waist during waking hours and to keep the accelerometer dry. Accelerometers were initialized fora 1-minute epoch at 60 Hz using ActiLife software. Participants wearing the accelerometer !3 days for !10 hours had their data processed and scored using valid cut points for identifying moderate-to-vigorous exercise in people with MS. Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) is a self-report measure of health-related quality of life. Two subscales, mental and physical function, are calculated on a scale from 1-100 for analysis. Higher scores indicate worse health-related quality of life. The MSIS is commonly used in research and is considered reliable and valid. Treatment fidelity and possible confounders Treatment fidelity was measured by tracking attendance and monitoring the delivery of the interventions. Occupational therapists and independent reviewers completed checklists on the content covered during the session.

      "value": "Based on recent systematic reviews of the literature, this is the first RCT to compare the effects of promoting physical activity alone and combined with fatigue self-management behaviors in people with MS. It is also the first RCT to examine the effects of a telephone-delivered intervention consisting of group teleconferences and individually tailored phone calls. Last, it is the first RCT of a physical activity intervention to include adults with MS who are inactive and have moderate-to-severe fatigue. Thus, this study contributes to a growing body of MS research on telerehabilitation, self-management, and behavior change. The study's hypothesis was partially supported. Compared with the CC intervention, the FMþ intervention maybe more effective in increasing physical activity and reducing fatigue impact at posttest. This is an important finding because telephone-delivered interventions may help increase accessibility of rehabilitation services. However, the FMþ intervention did not yield statistically significant improvements compared with the PA-only intervention. Furthermore, improvements in physical activity and fatigue impact decreased at follow-up. The CC intervention yielded some reductions in fatigue impact and increases in physical activity levels overtime, indicating that support, education, and outcome measurements may play an important role in changing behaviors. There was little evidence to indicate that targeting both physical activity and fatigue self-management behaviors in the same intervention had either a deleterious or synergistic effect on increasing physical activity levels or reducing fatigue impact. The study's results raise questions about the best ways to promote long-term behavior changes, the value of promoting multiple types of behaviors in a single intervention, and the optimal content and number of intervention contacts to promote desired changes.\nThe effects of the telephone-delivered interventions diminished overtime. Nonetheless, studies have reported that selfmanagement interventions can result in long-term benefits in reducing the impact of fatigue and improving quality of life among people with MS. However, these studies either tested interventions delivered in person, compared the intervention wtih a nontreatment control group, or found improvement trends that were not significantly different from the control at a long-term follow-up. Studies are needed to identify the factors that influence the formation of long-term habits in people with MS. Because the accountability fostered during an intervention is temporary, it is important to understand how to promote intrinsic motivation to engage in healthy behaviors.\nDespite the FMþ intervention consisting of 3 additional group teleconference sessions, it was not significantly better than the PAonly intervention in terms of promoting physical activity or reducing the impact of fatigue. In fact, the trends in our study suggest that the PA-only intervention was slightly more effective in promoting physical activity than the FMþ intervention. This could indicate that additional content on managing fatigue is not necessary to promote physical activity, changing both physical activity and fatigue management behaviors in the same intervention maybe too challenging or overwhelming for participants, or content on fatigue management was not delivered in an optimal way. Few studies have examined the optimal number of intervention sessions needed to promote behavior changes. Future research should focus on identifying the minimal number of sessions needed to promote behavior change. This could lead to more cost-effective interventions.\nSeveral studies have documented how the Managing Fatigue intervention delivered in various formats can be effective for significantly improving scores on the FIS. A common aspect to these studies is that the adaptations made to the Managing Fatigue intervention preserved the content and practice activities from the original 6 sessions. The present study used 3 of the 6 sessions and had participants choose additional session content during their individual phone calls. Possibly, to maximize the benefits of the Managing Fatigue intervention, all 6 sessions must be delivered in the sequence of the original Managing Fatigue intervention.\n",

      "value": "Limitations to this study include the recruitment of highly motivated participants, lack of participant and OT blinding, the high number of individuals screened for the study, the use of self-report questionnaires for the majority of outcomes, and the higher than expected attrition rate. Recruitment biases and the single-blind design are common problems in rehabilitation research. However, the CC intervention somewhat controlled for these potential biases. The study is generalizable for inactive adults with MS who have moderate-to-severe fatigue and who primarily use a cane, but not a walker or wheelchair, for mobility. Because of the small effect sizes found in this study, there is a need to optimize telephone-delivered interventions and replicate results. Future studies might also include performance-based measures of fatigue and physical function.\nThe higher than expected attrition rate was somewhat mitigated by using a mixed effects model, recruiting a larger sample size than needed to achieve adequate power, and the finding of no significant differences among the intervention groups in missing data. Nonetheless, the higher attrition rate for participants in the PA-only intervention may have resulted in an overestimation of its effects. Furthermore, the large CIs calculated for beta coefficients may indicate a larger sample size was needed or there was response heterogeneity to the interventions. Accelerometer data should also be interpreted with caution, given the amount of missing data. Participants with missing data were more likely to experience health barriers (eg, exacerbations) to engaging in physical activity and may have been less likely to wear the accelerometer. However, sensitivity analyses using a Bayesian approach yielded consistent results in the accelerometer data.\nThe frequent number of falls, exacerbations, and orthopedic injuries that occurred during the study is concerning. However, these findings are consistent with other observational studies. Furthermore, exacerbations and orthopedic injuries were measured using self-report questionnaires, which may have exaggerated overall rates. Nonetheless, there were no significant differences among the interventions, so falls, exacerbations, and injuries were likely unrelated to the physical activity program. We further note that the decision to provide extra teleconference sessions for the FMþ intervention compared with the PA-only intervention was based on the need to deliver extra content in the FMþ intervention. An alternative design would have been to provide participants in the PA-only intervention with extra content on physical activity, but this would have created differences between the PA-only and FMþ interventions in terms of the amount of physical activity content delivered.\n",
