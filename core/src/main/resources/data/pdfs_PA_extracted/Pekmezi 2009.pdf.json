      "value": "P articipation in regular physical activity can help prevent weight gain and reduce risk for developing chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes. Despite these health benefits, most Americans do not engage in an adequate amount of physical activity. Rates of inactivity (53.4%) and related medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity) are particularly high among Latinos relative to non-Hispanic whites (35.3%). These health disparities maybe due to cultural, socioeconomic, and language barriers that limit access to health promotion programs, and they call for intervention. Several studies have examined the efficacy of Spanishlanguage physical activity programs in Latino samples, but most focused on group-based approaches. For example, it has been found that a 6-month, Spanish-language aerobic group dance program produced significant increases in vigorous exercise and fitness at 12 months in a sample of 151 low-income Latinas, compared to the attention control condition. Another group-based program available in Spanish (Las Mujeres Saludables) was led by community health advisors and significantly increased physical activity from 65.15 minutes/week at baseline to 122.4 minutes/week post-intervention (3 months) in a sample of 366 Latinas.\nAlthough Spanish-language group-based programs have increased activity levels in several Latino samples, socioeconomic barriers, such as lack of transportation, can often interfere with participation. In addition, these programs typically have limited enrollment, thus reducing potential reach. Possible solutions may include using computerized technology to improve reach and/or accessibility of interventions for this underserved population. Several studies have successfully used computer expert system-driven interventions based on social cognitive theory and the transtheoretical model to increase physical activity among predominantly non-Hispanic white samples. And although computer-based programs have already shown potential in terms of improving nutrition in Latino samples, the application of behavioral informatics to physical activity has yet to be examined among Latinos.\nThus, the current study involved culturally and linguistically adapting an existing empirically supported, computer-tailored physical activity intervention. Then, an RCT was conducted, testing hypotheses that the modified program would produce significantly greater increases in physical activity and associated process variables (i.e., stages and processes of changes, self-efficacy) from baseline to postintervention (6 months) among a Latina sample than a Spanish-language wellness contact control condition.\n",

      "value": "The Seamos Activas study occurred in two phases. First, an existing empirically supported individually tailored physical activity print intervention was culturally and linguistically adapted for Latinas. This formative research was conducted by bilingual/bicultural staff with participants recruited through community advertisements and similar in demographics to the current sample. Intervention materials and research measures were translated into Spanish through an iterative process involving both translation and back-translation. Next, 25 cognitive interviews were conducted with Latinas to improve the clarity of intervention and assessment text and to ensure that key messages were not lost in translation. For example, participants noted differences between the terms exercise and physical activity, with exercise being more accurately associated with purposeful moderate-intensity activity. Like-wise, rewarding yourself for meeting exercise goals emphasized material goods more than doing something good for yourself and was perhaps inappropriate considering the low-income target group. These findings had implications for both the assessment and intervention, and revisions were made accordingly (e.g., exercise was consistently referenced in measures and materials).\nSix focus groups were conducted to identify culturespecific attitudes and barriers to physical activity for Latinas. Themes from participant feedback were incorporated into the intervention text and included balancing caregiver and household responsibilities, cultural norms about selfsacrifice, social support, partner negotiation, and dealing with inclement weather and neighborhood safety.\nThen, after a small demonstration trial (nϭ12), a randomized trial was conducted to compare the culturally and linguistically adapted physical activity intervention to wellness contact control materials. The main dependent variable was self-reported moderate-intensity or greater physical activity per week at baseline and 6 months as measured by the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall (7-Day PAR).\n",

The 7-Day PAR is an interviewer-administered instrument that provides an estimate of weekly minutes of physical activity and uses multiple strategies for increasing accuracy of recall, such as breaking down the week into daily segments (i.e., morning, afternoon, evening) and asking about many types of activities, including time spent sleeping and in moderate, hard, and very hard activity. This measure has consistently demonstrated acceptable reliability, internal consistency, and congruent validity with other more objective measures of activity levels, as well as sensitivity to changes in moderate-intensity physical activity overtime. Stages and processes of change and self-efficacy measures were administered monthly through the mail and used to generate tailored expert-system feedback reports for intervention participants.

In addition, the expert system provided normative feedback on how a participant compares to profiles of individuals who have successfully adopted and maintained physical activity, as well as feedback regarding the individual's progress to date in terms of physical activity participation and associated process variables.

      "value": "Because effective, innovative interventions are needed to address inactivity and related health disparities among Latinas, the current study examined the use of individually tailored physical activity print interventions in a Latina sample. Overall, results were promising and indicated that the intervention condition produced larger increases in moderate-intensity or greater physical activity from baseline to 6 months than the wellness contact control condition. Contrary to the hypotheses, group differences in physical activity did not reach significance. Possible reasons include small sample size and the increases in physical activity reported by both groups. Improvements in the control group may have been due to the targeted, high-quality nature of the wellness contact control materials and/or response bias. Past studies have documented high levels of acquiescent and socially desirable responses in Latino samples. And the interviewer-administered format of physical activity assessment in the current study may have contributed to this problem. Other interesting findings included improvements in process variables, which are often followed by actual increases in physical activity behavior and serve as early indicators of change.\nFor example, intervention participants reported significantly greater increases in cognitive and behavioral processes of change, as well as access to physical activity supplies and equipment at home, from baseline to 6 months, relative to control participants. Although the intervention did not result in significantly increased access to nearby neighborhood physical activity facilities, a 6-month program may not belong enough to have a substantial impact on such environmental variables. And finally, the feasibility and acceptability of using this approach to promote physical activity in the target population was evidenced by high retention and participant satisfaction with the program at 6 months.\nLimitations to the current study include use of a convenience sample and lack of objective data. Strengths of the current study include the randomized controlled research design and diverse sample of Latinas. Because most research in this area has focused on Mexican Americans, and activity levels and health vary among Latino subgroups, studies with individuals from other countries of origin are needed to broaden the existing literature on physical activity promotion in Latinos to more accurately reflect the community as a whole.\nOther strengths include the use of proactive retention strategies. For example, the formative research phase provided an opportunity to learn about barriers the target population might experience in terms of participation in physical activity and clinical trials and to resolve these issues (e.g., childcare, transportation) before attrition occurred. Brand recognition strategies, such as having a study name (Seamos Activas) and logo included on all recruitment, assessment, and intervention materials, helped promote awareness and familiarity with the program and to build a sense of community among participants. The efforts to improve the cultural relevance of the program may have also had a positive impact on retention. The Latina participants responded favorably to receiving the intervention and assessments in Spanish and appreciated information addressing culture-specific barriers to physical activity for Latinos, as evidenced by questionnaire responses and letters to research staff.\nIn sum, findings from the current study support the application of behavioral informatics to promoting physical activity among Latinos. Such high-reach, lowcost approaches have great potential to positively affect public health and reduce health disparities, but more research with larger samples is needed to corroborate these findings.\n",
