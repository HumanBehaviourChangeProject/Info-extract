The primary outcome was available in 859 (85.3%) participants. There was no significant between-group difference in activity volume at 3 months (adjusted intervention effect 8.8 counts per minute; 95% CI −18.7 to 36.3; p = 0.53). We found no significant between-group differences in the secondary outcomes of step counts per day, time spent in moderate or vigorous activity, time spent in vigorous activity, and time spent in moderate-intensity activity (accelerometer-derived variables); as well as in total physical activity, home-based activity, work-based activity, leisure-based activity, commuting physical activity, and screen or TV time (self-reported physical activity variables). Of the 505 intervention participants, 491 (97%) received the Step it Up intervention. Analysis of 37 intervention consultations showed that 60% of Step it Up components were delivered faithfully. The intervention cost £18.04 per participant. Incremental cost to the NHS per 1,000-step increase per day was £96 and to society was £239. Adverse events were reported by 5 intervention participants (of which 2 were serious) and 5 control participants (of which 2 were serious).

Worldwide, physical inactivity is responsible for 6% of coronary heart disease, 7% of type 2 diabetes, 10% of breast cancer, 10% of colon cancer, 9% of all-cause mortality, 3.8% of dementia cases, and 13.4 million disability-adjusted life years. The global cost of physical inactivity was estimated at US$67.5 billion (£46.9 billion, €51.0 billion) in 2013, and the direct cost to the UK National Health Service (NHS) was estimated to be £0.9 billion in 2006-2007 (US$1.34 billion, €1.1 billion, converted at 2007 Purchasing Power Parity).\nIn healthcare settings, very brief interventions (VBIs), defined as deliverable within 5 minutes, are promising: they are potentially scalable and can reach many people cheaply with limited time requirement for health practitioners. Very brief opportunistic behaviour change advice in health and care settings is advocated, for instance, by the Department of Health and Social Care for England and local government. Evidence supports the effectiveness [9] and cost-effectiveness of brief interventions of up to 30 minutes (albeit based on selfreported physical activity), but there is uncertainty about VBIs.

Participants were invited to the NHS Health Check by mail and were encouraged to make an appointment with their practice and to mention their interest in taking part in the trial.\nAt the start of the Health Check, the health practitioner obtained informed consent from participants following Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Patients who consented were asked to complete a short questionnaire used to characterise the sample and were randomised. The remainder of the consultation was the usual NHS Health Check (control group) and, additionally, Step it Up for intervention participants. Practitioners were asked to use the CRF as a prompt and a written record of the consultation, which included assessment of self-reported baseline physical activity level.\nParticipants in the control group received the usual NHS Health Check only. This included blood pressure measurement, calculation of BMI from measured height and weight, and collection of a blood sample. This information was used to calculate the patient's modelled CVD risk over the next 10 years and guide the offer of appropriate support.

The key behaviour change techniques (BCTs) included in Step it Up were goal setting, action planning, feedback, and self-monitoring of behaviour.

They were given a Step Chart and encouraged to use this to set weekly step goals and record daily steps.

Participants were posted an accelerometer on an elastic belt and asked to wear it around their waist on the right hip for 7 consecutive days during waking hours. Data were collected at 60 Hz and integrated into 10-second epochs; we removed non-wear time defined as �90 minutes of consecutive zeros (on the vertical axis) and summarised remaining vector magnitude data into average acceleration (cpm). Data were considered valid if there were at least 3 days of data, each day requiring �600 minutes of wear time. Secondary physical activity outcomes derived from accelerometer data were step counts (average step counts per day, derived from frequency analysis) as well as average number of minutes per day spent in moderate activity (2,690-6,166 cpm), vigorous activity (�6,167 cpm), and moderate or vigorous activity (�2,690 cpm). We did not analyse sedentary/light intensity activity (<2,690 cpm) because it represented an internal category of the variable that would not have a practical interpretation. We collected self-reported physical activity data using the validated Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire (RPAQ), which participants completed following accelerometer wear.\nWe assessed primary and secondary NHS care contacts and out-of-pocket expenditure on health, sports clubs, or other physical activities via a bespoke questionnaire.

We obtained 63 audio recordings from out of 23 practices: 37 intervention and 26 control consultations. All consultations were independently doubly coded. Interrater reliability was >75% for all but one item, so we used the data of the main coder for analysis.

As attrition was lower than anticipated at 15%, we could recruit fewer participants in accordance with our protocol.\nWe conducted our analyses according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines (S1 Table and agreed the analysis plan a priori with the independent Trial Steering Committee. We used analysis of covariance to test for intervention effects on continuous outcomes and quantified these with differences in means and 95% CIs, adjusting for primary care practice, sex, and age. We used an Intention to Treat (ITT) approach, supported by a Per Protocol (PP) analysis for the primary outcome analysis. The PP population comprised the subset of the ITT population who received their randomised intervention as determined from the CRF completed by the practitioners. All significance tests were two-sided and assessed at the 5% level of significance, and secondary outcome results were interpreted cautiously due to multiple comparisons.\nMissing data for the primary outcome were handled within a sensitivity analysis. This examined the robustness of the main analysis result to its 'Missing at Random' (MAR) assumption by exploring the impact of departures from this assumption on the primary outcome results. We examined a set of optimistic and pessimistic scenarios for the intervention effect size in participants with missing data by prespecifying a range for accelerometer cpm from −50 cpm to +50 cpm over which the mean of the 'unobserved outcome data' in a group might depart (or be different) from the mean of the 'observed outcome data' in that group. Three scenarios were examined in the sensitivity analysis. These reflect whether departures from the MAR assumption applied within the intervention group only, within the control group only, or within both groups equally and in the same direction (thereby potentially cancelling out across the sensitivity range, if the dropout rate were to be the same in both groups).\nWe examined prespecified subgroup variables in relation to the primary outcome: baseline CVD risk, sex, age (40-59, 60-74 years), ethnic group, educational qualifications, employment status, household income, marital status, home ownership, vehicle ownership, a deprivation score (calculated by scoring one point for each of the following: no qualifications, unemployed or full-time student, renting their home, no cars), and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2007, derived from the participant's home postal code.

Point estimate incremental cost per 1,000 steps per day was £96.32 from the NHS and £238.89 from the societal perspectives.\nBased on practitioner records, 491 of 505 participants received the Step it Up intervention as planned (Fig). Table shows the process evaluation findings. At 3-month follow-up, significantly more intervention than control participants recalled receiving physical activity advice and intervention materials and reported enacting BCTs (e.g., using a pedometer to count their steps) in daily life.\nThe in-depth fidelity assessment revealed that contamination was minimal: intervention components were delivered in more than 30% of control group sessions for 3 components only, related to discussing physical activity recommendations. This was included in routine Health Checks in several practices, constituting variation in routine care rather than contamination.\nAn estimate of fidelity of intervention delivery based on an in-depth assessment of 37 of 505 (7.3%) audio-recorded consultations was 60%, meaning that-on average-9 out of 15 components were delivered. Components that were relatively poorly delivered concerned the BCTs: giving feedback on physical activity (51.4%), mentioning the effectiveness of pedometers (18.9%), and prompting goal setting (21.6%). Components to promote participant engagement were also relatively poorly delivered, e.g., asking participants whether they were aware of the physical activity recommendations (29.7%) and whether they had any questions (18.9%). There was large variability infidelity of delivery across practices and practitioners. The average duration of the Health Check was a mean (SD) of 15 minutes and 16 seconds (6 minutes and 24 seconds). The average duration of VBI delivery was a mean (SD) of 3 minutes and 9 seconds (1 minute and 51 seconds).\nDuring the trial, 10 participants reported adverse events, 5 in the intervention and 5 in the control group. Four of these were serious adverse events, 1 in the intervention group (stitches to ahead injury after falling while cycling) and 2 in the control group (sepsis and surgery after hospital admission, and being fitted with a pacemaker after experiencing blackouts, respectively).

      "value": "We discuss potential explanations for our findings in terms of study design, intervention, target group, and context. We demonstrated robust trial execution, so results are unlikely to be due to randomisation errors, confounding, selection bias, differential dropout, or contamination. The two groups were well matched at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Retention at follow-up was high at 85%, and any differences between those lost to follow-up and those who completed follow-up were similar enough in the two groups not to influence the main result. Any differences between groups at follow-up may have been attenuated by higher reactivity of control group participants to wearing an accelerometer as they had not previously received a pedometer. Such reactivity has been observed in previous physical activity trials. Contamination was minimal and does not explain the findings. Suboptimal intervention delivery by practitioners, lack of participant engagement, and insufficient use of key recommended strategies in daily life are potential explanations. Setting physical activity goals is a key strategy, but at 3 months, only 49% of intervention participants-compared with 31% of control participants-reported setting physical activity goals. This maybe due to the finding from the in-depth fidelity assessment that practitioners rarely prompted goal setting. Intervention duration was just over 3 minutes, 2 minutes less than planned (as estimated from the audio recordings) and shorter than the 5 minutes in our previous trial, in which fidelity of delivery of the pedometer intervention was higher at 72%. Brief physical activity advice to control participants may have diluted any effect, but the fidelity assessment suggests that this did not happen. Rather, relatively poor delivery of the BCTs and strategies to increase participant engagement may explain the findings. The training in study procedures proved time-consuming and challenging for some practitioners, which may have affected their ability to master intervention delivery. Perhaps practitioners were rushed for time, lacked skills in engaging participants, or lacked confidence in delivering very brief advice. Finally, the intervention content, which focused on self-monitoring using pedometers, may have been ineffective. However, meta-analyses have shown that more intensive pedometer interventions increase physical activity, and we selected and optimised the intervention after extensive development and pilot work.\nOur target group was already relatively active, and there may have been limited capacity fora VBI to have an effect over and above the Health Check alone. At follow-up, objectively measured step counts in the control group (which provides the best estimate of the absolute physical activity distribution at baseline), though not accounting for any NHS Health Check effect, was 8,191 steps per day. This is slightly higher than observed in similar trials of pedometerbased interventions in UK primary care in Pedometer And Consultation Evaluation [PACE-UP]) as well as higher than 7,380 in the control group and 7,314 in the intervention group of Pedometer Accelerometer Consultation Evaluation-Lift (PACE-Lift). Our intervention had a positive effect among participants with lower CVD risk and a negative effect in those with higher risk, although we interpret this cautiously given the inconsistent directions of effect, the number of subgroup tests, and the very small effect size. Other trials have not found significant associations between cardiovascular risk factors and change in physical activity.\nStep it Up was delivered in a consultation focusing on vascular disease risk, which rendered physical activity benefits for disease prevention particularly salient, whereas our participants were on average 56 years and not on disease registers. Health Checks may not have been the optimal context, although participants in our previous studies mentioned that a discussion about physical activity during Health Checks was a good reminder.\nThe effectiveness of Step it Up maybe increased by better delivery of BCTs and patient engagement in the consultation; offering repeated VBIs; referral to follow-up support delivered by digital technologies, by phone, or face to face; and by having an environment that is supportive of walking and cycling. This requires new research into their cost-effectiveness. Given current financial constraints in the NHS, practitioners could signpost apparently healthy adults of preretirement age to relatively cheap external support such as mobile phone applications or encourage them to purchase a pedometer. VBIs to promote physical activity might best be offered opportunistically to people with long-term conditions for which physical activity is an important component of disease management, as well as to older adults to halt the age-related decline in physical activity, alongside prescribing medication to reduce risk. A populationbased study with repeated physical activity measures showed that middle-aged and older adults, including people with CVD and cancer, can live longer by becoming more physically active, irrespective of past activity levels and risk factors. Physical inactivity is a habitual, environmentally cued behaviour. Inactivity is not simply a challenge for the health service but is a societal problem requiring a multisectoral, multidisciplinary public health response.\n",

      "value": "A key strength of our trial was its internal validity. We had a sufficiently large sample size to be able to detect a small effect. Our sample was well-balanced, and retention at 3-month followup was high in both arms. We used a validated objective measure of physical activity and population-based sampling from primary care registers. The intervention was novel in terms of its brevity and inclusion of evidence-based BCTs and was based on extensive development and pilot work.\nWhile it could be argued that absence of baseline measurement is a potential limitation, we believe this not to be the case. With a large sample size and high retention, comparison of values of a precise, objective physical activity measure between intervention and control groups gives a valid estimate of effect. Our estimate is also a fairly good measure of change, assuming that physical activity was similar in the two groups at baseline due to randomisation and follow-up too short for population shifts in the outcome. The main advantage of baseline measures is the improvement in precision due to correlation and ability to analyse group changes overtime, but our large sample size provided sufficient precision. On the other hand, baseline measurement in a pragmatic trial of a VBI has several disadvantages. Measurement effects may preclude an intervention effect on behaviour. Our pilot work showed that baseline measurement, which included objectively measured physical activity, reduced NHS Health Check uptake, which was not acceptable to participating practices as Health Checks constitute routine care. Physical activity screening during the Health Check to exclude very active adults prior to randomisation was not feasible as it would have added time and changed routine practice. Our participants were more active than might have been expected, potentially reducing room for improvement, although self-reported physical activity at baseline did not moderate any intervention effects.\nExternal validity or generalisability from clinical trials is limited by participant profile. Sixteen percent (1,007/6,200) of adults invited agreed to take part and were randomised. This participation rate was similar to the PACE-UP trial, which used population-based sampling in a similar age group (10%), and was lower than PACE-Lift (30%), which recruited among adults in the retirement age from practice records. Our participants were representative of adults attending NHS Health Checks in the East of England. During 2015 and 2019, 47.4% of eligible people in England took up an NHS Health Check invitation. The majority of adults aged 40 to 74 years are employed and may lack time for trial participation. Attrition was low overall, slightly greater in the intervention arm, but this was not found to influence the main finding. Finally, only 13 of 23 practices returned audiotapes, and observed fidelity levels may overestimate actual levels.\n",

      "value": "The UK PACE-Lift trial evaluated a 10-week pedometer-based intervention in primary care consisting of four 30-minute, individually tailored sessions with practice nurses and found a significant effect at 3 and 12 months (1,037 and 609 additional steps per day, respectively). The UK PACE-UP trial evaluated a 12-week pedometer-based intervention delivered by mail only and by mail plus three 20-minute practice nurse consultations. Both interventions significantly increased step counts per day at 12 months (642 for the postal and 677 for the nurse intervention) and 3-year follow-up (627 for the postal and 670 for the nurse intervention) compared to the control group, which received usual care, with no significant additional benefit of the nurse intervention at either follow-up.\nOur findings do not imply that primary care practitioners should refrain from providing (very) brief physical activity advice opportunistically as our evidence is limited to NHS Health Checks. They should be considered in the context of meta-analytic evidence supporting intensive pedometer interventions in predominantly small samples of younger participants, the potential scope for more faithful delivery of VBIs, 30-minute brief physical activity advice in primary care, more intensive pedometer-based interventions in primary care among slightly less active participants who received individualised walking plans, and contacts with practice nurses or research assistants.\n",
