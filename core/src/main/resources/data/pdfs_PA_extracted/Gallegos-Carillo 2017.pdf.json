      "value": "The effectiveness of clinical-community linkages for promotion of physical activity (PA) has not been explored in low-and middle-income countries. This study assessed the effectiveness of a primary care-based, 16-week intervention rooted in behavioral theory approaches to increase compliance with aerobic PA recommendations.\nStudy design: Pragmatic cluster randomized trial.\nSetting/participants: Patients had diagnosed (o5 years) hypertension, were aged 35-70 years, self-reported as physically inactive, had a stated intention to engage in PA, and attended Primary Healthcare Centers in the Social Security health system in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Of 23 Primary Healthcare Centers, four were selected based on proximity (5 km radius) to a center.\nIntervention: Each center was randomized to a brief PA counseling (BC, n¼2) or an exercise referral (ER, n¼2) intervention. The study was conducted between 2011 and 2012.\nMain outcome measures: Change in objectively measured PA levels (ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers) at baseline, 16, and 24 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses were used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention overall and according to ER intervention attendance. Longitudinal multilevel mixed-effects analyses considering the interaction (time by intervention) were conducted. Each model was also adjusted by baseline value of the outcome measure, demographic and health variables, social support, PA self-efficacy, and barriers.\nResults: Minutes/week of objectively measured moderate to vigorous PA increased by 40 and 53 minutes in the ER and BC groups, respectively (p¼0.59). Participants attending 450% of ER program sessions increased their moderate to vigorous PA by 104 minutes/week and compliance with aerobic PA recommendations by 23.8%, versus the BC group (both po0.05).\nConclusions: Both BC and ER led to modest improvements in PA levels, with no significant differences between groups. Adequate adherence with the ER program sessions led to significant improvements in compliance with aerobic PA recommendations versus BC. These results can help guide development and implementation of programs integrating standardized PA assessment, counseling, and referrals via clinical-community linkages in Mexico and other low-and middle-income countries in the region.",

      "value": "P hysical inactivity is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and is responsible fora high burden of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs). Improving and maintaining health-enhancing levels of physical activity (PA) leads to reductions in risk factors that contribute heavily to the development of many NCDs. As such, PA has a role, in many cases comparable or superior to pharmaceutical interventions, in the prevention and treatment of NCDs. Insufficient PA affects national economies and health systems, being responsible for an estimated 1.5%-3% of direct healthcare costs in several countries, and recently estimated at $110 billion dollars/year or approximately 10% of the aggregate healthcare expenditure in the U.S.\nTo combat low levels of PA, several proven approaches have been identified. Evidence supports the use of multipronged PA counseling and referral strategies, in particular, those linking counseling in healthcare settings with referral to community-based PA resources. Physician counseling and exercise referral (ER) systems can be effective in improving patients' self-reported PA levels for up to 12 months. 9,10 However, to date, only one study has explored the effectiveness of these approaches using objective PA measurements. Despite increasing evidence regarding the cost effectiveness and scalability of approaches to integrate PA in healthcare settings, widespread implementation has been inconsistent, with a few exceptions. Low and middleincome countries (LMICs) are experiencing a rapid increase in the prevalence of NCDs with 80% of NCD-related deaths occurring in LMICs. Mexico, the 11 th most populated country in the world, is a mediumincome country with some of the highest rates of years of potential life lost due to diabetes and obesity, conditions that are putting Mexico in a vulnerable position, worse than or comparable to other LMIC countries. However, data on the prevalence of physical inactivity are still inconsistent in countries like Mexico, partially because of the use of different assessment tools, scoring approaches, and the self-reported nature of these assessments. For example, the National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico reported a physical inactivity prevalence of 56.2%. On the other hand, Hallal et al. reported a prevalence between 30% and 39% and Medina and colleagues between 16% and 20%. Despite differences in these estimates, physical inactivity and related NCD burden constitute a major public health problem in Mexico. Efforts to adapt proven interventions to the LMIC setting and provide specific contextual Type 3 public health evidence have been emphasized as an area where more PA research is needed.\nInformation about the effectiveness of PA counseling and ER strategies in LMICs will offer critical evidence to guide implementation efforts. Therefore, the aims of this study were to:\n1. evaluate the effectiveness of providing brief behavioral PA counseling (BC) in primary care facilities, compared with an ER scheme among inactive or insufficiently active hypertensive adults; and 2. assess the impact of the intervention according to the level of adherence to the ER program.\n",

Directors of the four PHCCs consented to their participation in the study.\nA pragmatic cluster randomized trial design was used, with PHCCs as the unit of randomization, and patients as the unit of assessment. Four PHCCs were randomized to deliver the ER intervention (n¼2) or the BC intervention (n¼2); this latter one served as a control in the comparison.\nSample size was based on the goal of increasing by 20% the proportion of patients meeting aerobic PA guidelines, plus an additional 40% to account for the high dropout rates reported previously. Therefore, for an 80% power and to detect group differences with the significance level set at 0.05, the final sample size was calculated as 224 patients (112 per intervention group).\nStaff physicians at the four PHCCs participating in the study were 108 men and women aged from 26 to 62 years. All study physicians attended a 2-hour training session focused on the importance of PA in the management of NCDs and were informed about the study's objectives and procedures for patient recruitment. The study took place between 2011 and 2012. A total of 506 potentially eligible inactive hypertensive patients were identified by physicians at the participating PHCCs according to the following criteria:\n1. women and men with IMSS affiliation; 2. aged 35-70 years; 3. mild hypertension for o5 years (o160 mmHg systolic, o100 mmHg diastolic ); 4. o150 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA)/week according to current PA WHO guidelines ; and 5. not in a pre-contemplative stage of behavior change (participants without intention to increase their PA in the next months).\nClinical criteria were used to identify patients at a low to moderate cardiovascular disease risk, cleared to engage in low to moderate PA without further exercise testing, according to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) exercise screening recommendations. Inclusion or exclusion criteria were confirmed by trained PHCC healthcare staff using a previously described standardized procedure.\n",

The ER intervention lasted 16 weeks. Primary outcomes and effectiveness assessment relied on objectively assessed PA data via ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers (ActiGraph LLC, Ft. Walton Beach, Florida). Participants wore the device for 7 days during waking hours. Valid wear time was defined as 5 days in 1 week (including at least 1 weekend day) and accumulation of Z600 minutes daily.

Measurement procedures have been reported previously.\nSecondary outcomes were attitudes toward PA participation based on Prochaska's stages of change model, a discrete categorical measure for the assessment of staged of behavior change with mutually exclusive questions. Social support for PA assessed the level of support from family and friends that study participants perceived. Self-efficacy during leisure time, walking, and planned PA was assessed with a questionnaire previously developed for use at IMSS.\nTo help guide PA prescription and detect the potential effect of the ER intervention on functional capacity, change in 6-minute walking distance was measured only in the ER group.\nDemographic and health data were collected, including the Charlson Comorbidity Index and other lifestyle behaviors, as well as barriers to engaging in PA.\n",

Systematic reviews have found that PA interventions not focused on reducing sedentary behavior have fewer possibilities of achieving a sedentary time reduction, compared with interventions focused on decreasing sedentary time. In this study, the BC and ER interventions did not aim to reduce sedentary behavior; future interventions may benefit from also including counseling and activities to limit sedentary time.\nPrevious meta-analyses have quantified the effect of PA promotion in healthcare settings at 38 minutes of MVPA/week (self-reported), comparing the intervention group to no intervention controls. In this study, both the ER and BC interventions led to similar increases of 40 and 53 minutes of MVPA/week, respectively, in objectively assessed PA from baseline to 24 weeks of follow-up.\nIn some studies, BC led to increases in PA levels and adding the ER component did not seem to enhance the effect. In other studies, increased PA was reported for intervention and control groups and systematic reviews have shown that both BC and ER interventions can be effective. However, few studies have performed a head-to-head comparison of these two commonly implemented PA promotion strategies. For instance, Sorensen et al. found no difference in maximum oxygen uptake between groups. Differences in study design and procedures for what constitutes \"counseling\" and ER programs make direct comparisons with previous studies difficult. However, the findings are generally consistent with previous reports.\nIn the present study, both ER and BC groups selfreported much higher increases in MVPA after the *SEDENTARY minutes/day: Statistically significant difference between ER and BC groups, tested as the (assessment time*intervention group) interaction, measured via accelerometer (p¼0.032).

In the Mexican population, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire has been shown to overestimate PA levels, compared with accelerometer assessments. Inconsistencies between objective and self-reported BMI have also been described in the Mexican population. Therefore, the probability of bias associated with selfreport is one of the limitations of PA interventions relying on such tools to assess change in PA overtime. Nevertheless, in this study, self-reported PA minutes at baseline were more or less consistent with the objective PA assessment for both ER and BC groups. This is inline with previous studies validating simple self-report PA tools. The impact of this behavioral theory-based ER program in helping patients achieve recommended PA levels was modest and heavily influenced by program attendance, as reported previously. A total of 78% of ER participants in this study attended Z50% of program sessions, a high proportion of adherence compared with prior trials. A systematic review of ER schemes reported a pooled level of adherence of 43% (95% CI¼32%, 54%) across six randomized trials. Follow-up measurements were carried out at the PHCC for the BC group (during monthly checkup to refill medication) whereas the ER group assessments were conducted at the SCC. In addition, BC intervention implied less commitment from participants, which could explain the higher dropout rate seen in the ER group. The detailed eligibility assessment conducted in this study might have affected the rate of initial ER program participation (uptake), with 78.6% of enrolled patients attending the initial session in which the exercise program was developed. This uptake rate was comparable to the those reported in similar programs (81%, 95% CI¼68%, 94%). Results among patients meeting adherence goals led to significant increases on MVPA levels (85 minutes/week) and an increase in compliance with PA recommendations (15.4%). Based on these findings, a larger sample size or better uptake and adherence rates maybe needed in future studies to better detect differences between ER and BC groups. In summary, this study shows that at least a 50% level of adherence to an ER scheme must be the programmatic goal; otherwise, BC can be a good alternative to promote PA in primary care settings.\n",

Although the authors would have liked to use a bigger sample size and enhance the study's power, real-life logistic (time, resources) and budgetary restrictions precluded doing so in this study. However, the multilevel analyses allowed the authors to account for the inherent correlation within the clusters being modeled with mixed-effects analyses including intercepts at the participants' level, nested in PHCCs, respectively. In addition, robust post-estimation was conducted using a bootstrap statistical approach for each model with resampling considering the four clusters used in the randomization. The resulting coefficients showed a similar magnitude of association to the original analyses, adding confidence in the results presented here. Third, MVPA variables were skewed to the left with a spike at 0 but normality transformations did not contribute when compared to the crude variable in the multilevel mixed-effects models. As an additional procedure to deal with this issue, the authors also explored a 0-inflated logistic regression analysis model defining 0 as the ref category and any other value for MVPA minutes as 1. In such a model, the value of the interaction term (assessment time X intervention group), went from 0.74 to 2.03. However, as this approach was not useful to address the main objective of this particular study, which was to determine the effectiveness of an exercise referral scheme to achieve the PA recommendation of 150 minutes of MVPA/week, it was not included in the Results section. The authors acknowledge the limitations of the analyses carried out in this study, which could have affected the efficiency of the models and the magnitude of effects. In addition, owing to logistic limitations, objective assessment of PA at T1 for the BC group was not possible. Finally, the detailed screening assessment maybe difficult to replicate in real-life settings. However, recently the ACSM has published simplified exercise preparticipation guidelines that should facilitate this process. The present results are only generalizable to similar populations in Mexico and the Latin American region. The IMSS population comes from a catchment area representative of a medium-sized city with medium to high SES in Mexico. Therefore, studies are needed in populations with different characteristics to generate detailed contextual evidence to guide implementation. This study also had strengths. First, objective PA assessments were used to ascertain intervention effectiveness. The trial was clustered by PHCC to reduce the risk of intervention contamination. Better results have been obtained when interventions include multiple behavioral change resources and target insufficiently active patients with cardiovascular disease risk factors and motivational readiness to change. Following these recommendations, the ER intervention was rooted in Social Cognitive Theory, with targeted enrollment based on self-reported activity levels, cardiovascular disease risk factors (hypertension), and stages of change.\n",

      "value": "In this study, implementing brief BC and an ER program led to modest improvements in PA levels, with no significant differences between groups. However, significant improvements in meeting PA recommendations among patients attending Z50% of ER program sessions were observed. A similar finding has been reported in relation to program adherence for real-world implementation of lifestyle interventions for diabetes prevention. Large discrepancies were found between self-reported and objective PA assessment methods, which suggest exercising caution when using self-report instruments to assess baseline PA levels for intervention eligibility and particularly for assessing intervention effectiveness in future trials. These findings support the recommendation by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to incorporate objective assessments to capture behavioral domains in electronic health records.\nIn conclusion, integrating PA counseling and providing referrals to community-based programming led by certified PA professionals appear to be promising strategies for implementing PA promotion in Mexico's healthcare system. In Mexico, IMSS is a large healthcare system that already has adequate infrastructure to increase the feasibility of delivering prevention and intervention PA programs via clinical community linkages. Based on the available evidence, future efforts to integrate PA promotion into one of the biggest programs of health promotion in Mexico called \"PREVENIMSS\", IMSS's preventive medicine strategy, are warranted. Under this program, activities such as standardized BC and ER schemes could be added as a benefit for the population. Scaling BC and ER to larger populations will provide an important opportunity to assess the usefulness of these types of program in the context of social security health systems in the Americas.\n",
