      "value": "Background: Effective physical activity interventions are needed for children because health behaviors track into adulthood, and risk factors for diseases begin early in life. No study has determined whether an intervention designed using a Community-Based Participatory Research approach can improve moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and the related psychosocial constructs in underserved children. This study determined whether improvements in MVPA and related psychosocial constructs (self-efficacy, knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and skills) occurred following a Community-Based Participatory Research intervention in underserved, rural children. It was then determined if these constructs were mediators of MVPA. Methods: Two fifth-grade classes at a school (n = 19 and n = 20) were randomly assigned to an intervention or comparison group. The intervention group participated in a 4-week intervention designed to improve MVPA (wGT3X-BT accelerometer; ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) and the related psychosocial constructs (written survey). Groups were assessed prior to and immediately following the intervention. Results: There were no differences at baseline between groups. MVPA (30.0 [4.4] min), knowledge, and skill scores were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the comparison group at follow-up (P < .05). Knowledge and skills were mediating variables of MVPA. Conclusions: Priority should be placed on research that determines the sustained impact of similar Community-Based Participatory Research interventions.",

      "value": "Physical inactivity and obesity among children are increasing nationwide, especially among underserved, minority groups. According to the national guidelines published by the US Department of Health and Human Services, children aged 6-17 years should engage in 60 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) most days of the week, 3 but, nationwide, only 47% of children meet this guideline; and, in Alabama, only 43% of children meet it. Moreover, studies have shown that underserved children who are of low socioeconomic status (SES) are even less physically active than children of higher SES. It has been estimated that those who participate in at least hours of MVPA a week have a 40% lower risk of premature death compared with those who are active for less than 30 minutes a week. Also, studies have shown that sufficient amounts of MVPA contribute to lower rates of a number of chronic diseases and conditions, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers (ie, liver, renal cell, breast, endometrial, and colon cancers). A good target group for physical activity (PA) interventions is children, especially high-risk, underserved children, because health behaviors track into adulthood, and risk factors for diseases begin early in life. A child who is physically active will be less likely to develop these risk factors. As behavioral patterns are formed mostly during childhood, efforts should focus on implementing interventions designed to increase PA behavior in children, especially underserved areas, such as the Black Belt of Alabama. Within the Black Belt, PA levels are particularly low (physical inactivity prevalence, 43.3% vs US prevalence, 25.6%), and chronic disease mortality rates are high (eg, all-cause cancer mortality rate, 251.8/100,000 person years vs US rate, 185.4/ 100,000 person years; cardiovascular disease mortality rate, 437.4/100,000 person years vs US rate, 252.6/1000 person years). Numerous interventions for children have been designed and implemented over the past 2 decades in an effort to increase PA levels, but most have been unsuccessful at improving overall PA in children. Most PA interventions for children have taken place in the school setting and have included guided instruction and supervised programs lasting 30 to 45 minutes for 3 to 5 days per week. Such PA interventions, however, have had little effect on overall PA levels, as these interventions rely, not on intrinsic motivation, but on extrinsic motivation guided by external reward or coercion, a strategy that has shown little success in achieving sustainable behavior change. Rather than attempting to increase PA activity through external rewards or coercion, an alternate approach is to design interventions that focus on improving psychosocial constructs, which have been shown to be mediators in increasing PA. Formulated from the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, psychosocial constructs associated with increased PA include selfefficacy, knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and skills. While previous interventions have been successful at improving PA immediately following an intervention by targeting the psychosocial constructs associated with PA, no study has determined whether PA and the related constructs can be improved in rural, underserved, low SES children following an educational video series intervention.\nDetermining the effectiveness of a video series, intervention would be beneficial, as videos can be accessed through the web, and they can reach any number of students in classrooms with Internet access. This type of intervention would be available for use at most schools, including low SES schools, because 97% of public schools nationwide have one or more computers in the classroom, and 93% of these computers have Internet access. Videos that are web based also enable students to revisit the material at their convenience at school, at the library, or at home. More importantly, members of a community can be enlisted to help design and implement the videos, while the substantive health information conveyed in the videos can be scripted and overseen by a health expert. Enlisting a community in a research project to design and implement a PA intervention increases the chances that the intervention will be culturally relevant to its participants, which, in turn, increases the chances that it will be effective. Community involvement when designing and implementing an intervention also has been shown to improve the sustainability of desired outcomes, even among low SES populations. Equitably involving both the community and investigators in the research process is an approach that is referred to as Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR). Psychosocial constructs associated with increased PA are mediating variables through which interventions work, and an intervention utilizing a CBPR approach can increase the chances that the intervention will be effective. Hence, the aim of the investigation was to determine if a school-based video intervention, designed and implemented using a CBPR approach, improved daily MVPA (wGT3X-BT; ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) through improving the psychosocial constructs (self-efficacy, knowledge, skills, attitudes, and beliefs) associated with increased PA of minority children residing in a rural community.\n",

      "value": "Students (10-11 y, n = 39) attending 2 fifth-grade classes in a public school located in Alabama's rural Black Belt Region were recruited for participation in the study. The Black Belt Region stretches across central Alabama, and it is named for its rich soil. Its residents are mostly African American who are at high risk for chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. The elementary school that was selected for this study was chosen because it was located in a Black Belt county. Moreover, a previous partnership had already been established between a community member in the county and a member of the research team, and the community partner was able to facilitate the partnership between the school and the researcher. Fifth-grade, preadolescent children were selected for the investigation because of the likelihood that they would be more willing than older children to respond favorably to a PA intervention, and behavioral change maybe easier to obtain among children rather than among teenagers or adults. Also, this intervention was designed for preadolescent children in an effort to combat the previously reported PA percentage decline of 1.8% to 2.7% per year in adolescent boys and 2.6% to 7.4% per year in adolescent girls.\n",

      "value": "Prior to beginning the investigation, ethical approval of the study methods was obtained by the nonmedical institutional review board at The University of Alabama to ensure that the methods conformed to the university's policies and procedures regarding scientific research using human subjects. Informed consent was obtained from the participants' parents, and assent was obtained from the children for all those who participated in the project. As this investigation sought to generalize the results with respect to healthy children, parents were instructed, on the informed consent form, to identify any health conditions limiting their child's PA participation. Depending on the severity of the health condition, some children may not have been eligible to participate in the study. Examples of health conditions that would have eliminated a child from participating in the study included known heart diseases, such as carditis, congenital heart disease, dysrhythmia, heart murmur, and vascular disease. However, after reviewing the returned information packets, it was determined that all children were eligible to participate. Out of the 40 information packets distributed, only one potential participant elected not to participate in the study. Thus, the study had a total of 39 participants. The 2 fifth-grade classes were randomly designated as either the class that would serve as the intervention group (n = 20) or the class that would serve as the comparison group (n = 19).\nA day before the 4-week, school-based PA intervention, several measurements were collected from the children in both the comparison and intervention groups, which served as baseline data. Height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms) were measured by the school nurse using a standard balance beam height and weight scale (model 402EXP; Health O Meter, Port Washington, NY). Body mass index (BMI) was determined from the participant's weight and height using a standard calculator, and BMI percentiles were then calculated using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's BMI-for-age charts. Objective assessments of MVPA behavior (in minutes per day; wGT3X-BT) were measured over 6 consecutive days (Wednesday-Monday) immediately prior to and following the intervention in both groups. On the Wednesday before and after the 4-week intervention, participants received the accelerometer to wear, and they were instructed to also wear the accelerometer on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and to school on Monday. The primary investigator (PI) verbally instructed the participants on how to wear the accelerometer. The comparison group was told that the study that they were being asked to participate in was to examine PA levels in children. At the end of the PA assessment period, the PI returned to the classroom to remove and collect the accelerometers.\nPsychosocial constructs associated with increased PA were also assessed immediately prior to and following the intervention in both the intervention and comparison groups. The groups were assessed separately through the use of a written survey consisting of 31 multiple-choice questions that addressed the psychosocial constructs of interest. In addition to the psychosocial questions, the survey asked participants to state their birthday, gender, and race, information that was used to initialize the accelerometers that would be distributed a day later, and the survey asked the participants whether they were involved in organized sports at school or outside of school. Before the survey was administered, 2 fifth-grade teachers, the school principal, and the school nurse provided feedback on the surveys to ensure that the surveys were age appropriate. The survey administrator read each of the questions and answer choices as students completed the survey. To make the survey age appropriate and easily understandable to children who may have had poor literacy skills, emoticons were included by the answer choices to assist the participant in understanding the answers. The survey took approximately 20 minutes to complete.\nThe Tuesday following the baseline assessment served as the first day of the 4-week intervention. The 4-week, school-based PA video intervention sessions occurred every Monday and Friday (except for the first intervention day, which occurred on Tuesday because of a time constraint collecting baseline data) for 4 weeks during school hours. The intervention took place in an adjacent room to the gymnasium at the beginning of the class's physical education (PE) period. During this time, the comparison class attended PE. The first 15 minutes of PE consisted of sitting on the bleachers for roll call and receiving the day's instructions; therefore, it is assumed that the intervention group did not miss important activity time. Once the intervention video was over, the class then resumed activities with the other class in PE. The school principal made the decision on when the intervention occurred. A description of how the school-based video intervention was designed and filmed is detailed in a separate manuscript. The intervention was constructed using a CBPR approach, with active community involvement in both the design and filming of the videos. Each video incorporated various strategies to improve the psychosocial constructs associated with increased PA, and these strategies were depicted by local community members that included high school students, a high school sports coach, a nurse, and a worker from a nonprofit organization. Examples of strategies that were taught and depicted in the videos included how to make a measurable PA goal, how to make PA more enjoyable, how to overcome PA barriers, and how to use positive self-talk. Additionally, the community actors in the videos discussed different types of PA (aerobic, bone strengthening, and muscle strengthening) and the health benefits of PA, and then demonstrated different activities at various intensities. These strategies were derived from similar studies seeking to improve the psychological/psychosocial constructs associated with PA. Having familiar role models teach these strategies to fifth-grade children was also away to enhance the credibility of the information being provided, and it was thought that such role models would increase the likelihood of influencing the children to continue the learned PA behaviors well beyond the time period of the study. Adherence to the intervention was measured by taking class attendance each day before the intervention was shown. Students who were absent watched the missed videos on the next intervention day. One hundred percent of the intervention class watched all 8 of the intervention videos.\n",

      "value": "PA was evaluated with the wGT3X-BT accelerometer (Acti-Graph), and the data were analyzed using the ActiLife software (ActiGraph). The participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer for 6 consecutive days, removing it only for sleeping or performing activities that involved water (eg, bathing, swimming). The accelerometer was worn on the right side of the hip, attached by an elastic belt. The sampling rate of the device was set to 30 HZ, and because younger children engage in PA infrequent bursts of short durations, a 10-second epoch was used during the conversion of the raw data to activity minutes. Also, while the accelerometer had the capability to record counts for 3 axes, 1 axis measuring vertical movement was selected for conversion purposes as this is the number of axes used in the majority of accelerometer calibration studies. Accelerometer data were then classified into wear and nonwear intervals. The wear-time criteria set forth by Choi et al were used for this investigation, and only validated wear time was included in the analysis. For data recording purposes, a \"day\" followed the 70/80 rule, where a day was defined as the period during which at least 70% of the study population had recorded accelerometer data, and 80% of that observed period constituted a minimal day for inclusion in data analysis. To be included in the primary outcome of average minutes of MVPA, each day had to meet the 70/80 criteria. If individual days did not meet the aforementioned criteria, these days were not included in the overall average calculation of MVPA minutes per day. This equated to the participant wearing the accelerometer ≥10 hours per day and fora minimum of 3 weekdays and 1 weekend day.\nFor this investigation, PA was recorded as the average amount of minutes spent in each activity category during a day. The count ranges set forth by Mattocks et al were used and are as follows: sedentary (0-100), light (101-3580), moderate (3581-6129), and vigorous (6130-∞).\n",

Questions relating to the same psychosocial factor were grouped together in categories. All ordinal values in a category were summed creating a scale, thereby treating the combination of psychosocial determinant variables as a continuous variable. The majority of the psychosocial survey questions were borrowed from the Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise (PACE) Adolescent Psychosocial Scale, which has been validated and used with preadolescent children. Self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is defined as an individual's confidence that he or she can change or maintain a certain action or behavior. Self-efficacy has been shown to positively correlate with PA behavior and may also predict children's weekly PA participation, although the results among studies are conflicting. In this investigation, a modified version (validity coefficient, r = .74 [.73-.76]; reliability coefficient, α = .63) of McAuley's Self-Efficacy Scale was used for the participating children. Beliefs. Beliefs about PA behavior include both the perceived/ learned benefits in adopting a physically active lifestyle and the perceived/learned barriers that could hinder an active lifestyle. Nine questions that assessed the participants' beliefs about PA were borrowed from the PACE Adolescent Psychosocial Scale by Norman et al. Normal et al categorized belief questions into either \"pro\" or \"con\" questions, and questions were used to ascertain what participants perceived as the positive and negative aspects of participating in PA. The 9 Adolescent Psychosocial Scale pro and con questions had a reliability coefficient of .74 (.51-.86) and 0.86 (.74-.92), respectively. Attitudes. Attitudes about PA, either positive or negative, were also addressed in the survey. In general, children have been shown to participate in PA when they find PA enjoyable. Two questions came from PACE items that were designed to reveal feelings people may have when making a behavioral change (reliability coefficient = .75 [.53−.87]), and the third question came from the PACE's single-item measure that was designed to reveal a participant's level of enjoyment of PA (reliability coefficient = .43 [.15−.65]). Skills. Skills, another important construct in assessing the potential for PA behavior in children, are sometimes referred to in the literature as change strategies, or self-efficacy behavioral skills. Children are likely to become more physically active when they have the behavioral skills to be physically active. Examples of behavioral skills that were assessed in the survey were whether participants tracked the amount of their PA, whether they had coping strategies for dealing with PA barriers, and whether they set PA goals. Six questions included in the survey came from PACE items that were designed to reveal behavioral skills that helped or would help participants change their PA (reliability coefficient = .75 [.53−.87]). Knowledge. The participants' knowledge about PA was the final construct accessed. Seven factual questions about PA were included in the survey. The information used to formulate the questions came from the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. Previous studies have reported positive outcomes on children's PA, while also reporting knowledge as a mediator. Therefore, improved knowledge of PA, and having an awareness and understanding of its benefits, may have a positive impact on one's decision to improve his or her PA levels.\n",

Chi-square matrices and 1-way analysis of variances were used to assess characteristic differences at baseline between groups. An independent t test was used to determine MVPA minute-per-day differences between groups at baseline. An analysis of covariance, controlling for known PA moderators and covariates, was used to assess group differences in MVPA minutes per day at follow-up. Baseline psychosocial scores between groups were compared using a multivariate analysis of variance, or Mann-Whitney U tests for nonnormally distributed variables. These tests were then used to compare delta scores (postpre) between groups. The internal consistency of the psychosocial constructs was assessed using Cronbach α. A Cronbach α of ≥.60 signified acceptable internal consistency. Next, it was determined whether the psychosocial constructs were significant mediating variables of the intervention. A multiple linear regression adjusting for known moderators and covariates was run to determine if the group (intervention or comparison group) predicted MVPA minutes per day at followup. Pearson product-moment correlations, chi-square matrices, and 1-way analysis of variances were used prior to the regression analysis to test for collinearity between predictor variables. To ascertain whether the suspected mediating variables accounted for the effect of the intervention, the same regression model was rerun a second time, while statistically controlling for the suspected mediators. All analyses were performed using SPSS (version 22.0.0.0; IBM, Armonk, NY), and the a priori significance level was set to α < .05.

There were no differences between groups for gender, BMI percentiles, or sport participation. There were also no differences in MVPA minutes per day between groups at baseline. When controlling for known moderators (gender and sport participation) and covariates (BMI percentiles and baseline MVPA minutes per day), follow-up MVPA minutes per day was significantly higher in the intervention group (30.0 min) when compared with the comparison group (18.2 [3.0] min) (F 1 = 14.0, P = .001, r 2 = .46; Table).\nSelf-efficacy (Cronbach α = .63), skills (Cronbach α = .65), and knowledge (Cronbach α = .64) had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α ≥ .60), whereas beliefs (Cronbach α = .57) and attitudes (Cronbach α = .48) fell just short of achieving acceptable consistency.

The results from this investigation suggest that a school-based PA video intervention can positively influence MVPA, and the knowledge and skills psychosocial constructs associated with increased Contrary to this study, Wilson et al reported that skills did not improve following a 4-week intervention. Perhaps the difference in findings between the Wilson et al's study and this study can be attributed to the way the information was presented in the interventions. While the interventions in both the Wilson et al's study and the present investigation taught behavioral skills, such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and coping strategies for dealing with PA barriers, the present investigation used familiar community members and high school students in its videos to teach PA skills, whereas the Wilson et al's study used graduate students from outside the community. Using familiar role models in the videos may have enhanced the credibility, appeal, and relevance of the information presented to the participants, leading them to adopt new behavioral skills with regard to PA.\nA possible explanation as to why there was no apparent difference in the self-efficacy delta score between the intervention and comparison groups is that the median was already relatively high at baseline. Consequently, the delta score was inherently going to be small following the intervention because there was a small margin for improvement. To determine whether small delta scores are significantly different between groups, a much larger sample size than the sample size in this investigation (n = 39) would be required.\nThe intervention group's mean MVPA minutes per day remained relatively stable across time, whereas a decreasing MVPA trend was evident in the comparison group. Although many factors can affect MVPA, one possible explanation for the decreasing trend in the comparison group's MVPA is that ambient temperatures decreased between premeasures and postmeasures. The baseline measurements of the intervention and comparison groups were taken in early September when the mean ambient temperature was 26.7°C, whereas the follow-up measurements were taken in October, when the mean ambient temperature was 16.7°C. A previous study by Duncan et al focused on the effects that ambient temperature had on children's PA behavior, and it found a significant decrease in PA behavior when outdoor ambient temperature decreased 10°C, which was similar to that observed in this study. Other studies that have examined the effects of weather on children's activity patterns also have found that children's MVPA decreases with decreasing temperatures. In the current investigation, because the intervention group's MVPA remained stable despite a 10°C drop in ambient temperature, it is reasonable to surmise that the intervention offsets the typical declines in MVPA associated with decreasing mean ambient temperatures. Future interventions of this type should assess whether such interventions are effective in offsetting declines in MVPA, with greater decreases in ambient temperature and/or decreases in temperature spread out over a longer period of time. Notably, Belanger et al suggested that percentage declines of MVPA often associated with adolescence are in part due to declines in temperature. During their 5-year study, PA was lower during cold months and higher during warm months, but the increases during warm months did not compensate for decreases during cold months; consequently, yearly activity decreased 7%. Future interventions are needed to effectively address steady declines in PA associated with temperature decreases accompanying seasonal change.\nAlthough previous studies that have examined the effects of ambient temperature on children's PA have noted a correlation between a decrease in temperature and a decrease in PA, there is a need to examine whether, and to what extent, children's MVPA might decrease because of higher ambient temperature. This particular question has been examined in older adults, but no study has addressed whether high ambient temperatures adversely affect PA levels in children. Ideally, it would be beneficial to know the optimal range of ambient temperatures for maximum MVPA in children and the specific deviations from this range that would need to occur before one would expect to see significant declines in PA. Such knowledge would assist researchers in better understanding the effects ambient temperature has on the interventions they implement. Also, it would aid in comparisons of the same intervention used in studies conducted during different seasons and/or in different climates.\nStrengths of the present investigation include designing an intervention using a theoretical framework and CBPR approach and testing both the effect of the intervention on potential mediating variables and the relationship of mediating variables on the objective MVPA behavioral outcome. Also, the budget for this intervention was low, as the only equipment needed to produce the intervention was a video recording device, a computer, and video editing software. Of course, a video series intervention is easily disseminated in schools, either through Internet streaming or through video equipment/computers, as most schools in the United States, including those in underserved areas, have Internet service or the technology to show videos. Limitations of the investigation include the lack of generalizability of the results due to the inclusion of a single school and the study's small sample size, and the limitation of the intervention to strategies that only improve psychosocial constructs of PA when other factors (ie, parental and peer influence, and equipment access) have also been shown to influence PA behaviors. In addition, the beliefs and attitudes construct had a low Cronbach α coefficient signifying that the questions that were intended to represent these constructs failed to closely relate to one another and, thus, failed to accurately represent the construct. Future studies can address this limitation by exploring additional questions that can be added for each construct, thereby potentially increasing the Cronbach α coefficient, while, at the same time, taking precaution not to overburden the participant being surveyed.\nOne might argue that the short duration of the investigation was also a limitation because health behaviors are not considered to be sustainable until they are consistent for at least 6 months. While it is true that results from a 4-week intervention are too short to conclude whether learned behaviors were also sustainable, the purpose of this investigation was to determine if psychosocial constructs relating to PA could be improved by a community-based intervention that would also result in favorable MVPA. The results from this investigation suggest that a community-based PA video intervention can indeed positively influence psychosocial constructs, leading to favorable MVPA behavior. Because this investigation was the first of its kind to determine if an intervention designed using CBPR methods can positively influence MVPA among low SES children living in the Black Belt region of Alabama, it was important to first examine if behaviors could indeed be altered. The next step is to ascertain whether the intervention results are sustained overtime.\n",
