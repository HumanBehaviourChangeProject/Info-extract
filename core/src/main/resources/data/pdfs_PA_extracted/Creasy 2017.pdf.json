However, it remains unclear what type of physical activity prescription/programme is optimal for increasing physical activity during a standard behavioural weight loss intervention. This study examined changes in physical activity after a 12-week supervised programme prescribed in minutes per week (SUP-PA), an unsupervised programme prescribed in minutes per week (UNSUP-PA) and an unsupervised programme prescribed in steps per day (STEP).\nFifty-two adults who were overweight or obese (age: 43.5 ± 10.1 years, BMI: 31.5 ± 3.5 kg•m\n) were randomized to STEP (n = 18), UNSUP-PA (n = 17) and SUP-PA (n = 17). Subjects attended weekly in-person group intervention sessions and were prescribed a calorie-restricted diet (1,200-1,800 kcals•day À1 ) combined with increased physical activity (150 min•week À1 or 10,000 steps•day À1 with 2,500 brisk steps•day\n).\nAll three groups significantly increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (STEP: 80.6 ± 218.5 min•week\n, UNSUP-PA: 112.9 ± 180.4 min•week À1 and SUP-PA:\n151.1 ± 174.0 min•week À1 , p < 0.001) with no differences between groups (p = 0.94) or group by time interaction (p = 0.81). In addition, there were no significant differences in weight loss between the groups (p = 0.81).\nIn this short-term study, all three physical activity programmes increased physical activity and elicited modest weight loss when combined with a standard behavioural weight loss intervention.",

      "value": "Standard behavioural weight loss interventions typically recommend increasing physical activity and decreasing energy intake to promote weight loss. Previous weight loss interventions have prescribed physical activity to be performed in either supervised or unsupervised conditions. Supervised physical activity is typically completed in a health-fitness facility under the direct supervision of trained staff, such that adherence to the prescription (e.g. duration, frequency, intensity and type) can be monitored. However, generalizing the results of supervised trials may not reflect physical activity participation that would be observed in non-research settings where the majority of physical activity is unsupervised. In contrast, unsupervised research interventions may generalize and translate to non-research settings. In addition, unsupervised interventions maybe more convenient for participants, require less staff and be less expensive compared to supervised interventions.\nPrevious comparisons of supervised vs. unsupervised physical activity programmes in adults who are overweight or obese have produced inconsistent findings for changes in physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and weight. One limitation of these previous studies is that the unsupervised conditions relied on self-report measures to confirm adherence to the prescribed dose of physical activity. However, the availability of wearable technology facilitates objective measurement of prescribed aerobic moderate-tovigorous physical activity (MVPA) regardless of whether the activity is supervised or unsupervised. This wearable technology may not accurately assess activities such as resistance training; however, ambulatory free-living activities are detected by these monitors. Thus, it is possible to directly compare levels of aerobic physical activity participation in response to an unsupervised physical activity programme vs. a supervised programme (i.e. gold standard for research) using wearable technology. If both programmes invoke comparable results, this could have substantial impact on future physical activity interventions.\nThe primary aim of this study was to compare changes in objectively measured MVPA in adults who were overweight or obese and enrolled in a standard behavioural weight loss intervention with physical activity prescribed in either a supervised or unsupervised manner. Physical activity was prescribed as supervised with a targeted minute goal (SUP-PA), unsupervised with a targeted minute goal (UNSUP-PA) or unsupervised with a targeted step goal (STEP). Secondary outcomes included changes in weight, body composition, energy intake, cardiorespiratory fitness and other components of physical activity (e.g. sedentary behaviour [SED], light intensity physical activity [LPA] and steps).\n",

      "value": "The results of this study demonstrate that, when combined with a 12-week standard behavioural weight loss intervention, supervised and unsupervised physical activity result in increases in objective measures of physical activity. Moreover, STEP, UNSUP-PA and SUP-PA resulted in similar reductions in body weight and changes in body composition. These findings suggest that the three physical activity programmes examined in this study are feasible options for increasing physical activity and promoting weight loss within a standard behavioural weight loss intervention.  It is likely that weight loss outcomes were predominantly influenced by changes in energy intake. By design, STEP, UNSUP-PA and SUP-PA were given the same dietary recommendations and delivered via the same weekly behavioural lessons in an attempt to minimize variations in energy intake changes between groups. All three groups significantly reduced caloric intake by~400 to 500 kcals•day À1 across the intervention with no differences between groups. In addition, changes in macronutrient intake were also similar across treatment groups. Because there were no differences in energy intake, it is not surprising that there were no differences in weight change and body composition change between the groups.\nSTEP, UNSUP-PA and SUP-PA were successful at increasing levels of MVPA completed in bouts of ≥10 min with no differences between groups. Results of this study suggest that prescribing unsupervised physical activity can be just as effective as supervised physical activity for increasing MVPA completed in bouts of ≥10 min. This is important because MVPA, and more specifically MVPA completed in bouts of ≥ 10 min, are associated with improved long-term weight loss and weight maintenance. STEP, UNSUP-PA and SUP-PA demonstrated similar decreases in MVPA from weeks 8 to 12 despite physical activity recommendations remaining constant. It is unclear why all of the intervention conditions demonstrated this response, and further investigation of this pattern is warranted. However, while speculative, this may reflect the need for more effective behavioural strategies to sustain physical activity beyond the initial 8 weeks or for the final weeks leading up to study completion. In addition, all groups showed an increase in LPA and a decrease in SED across the 12-week intervention. Thus, all three physical activity programmes elicited similar physical activity responses including changes in SED, LPA and MVPA.\nThe observed weight losses are comparable to previous standard behavioural weight loss intervention that were 3-6 months in duration. Results of the current study closely parallel the findings of Craighead and Blum, which found that combining a standard behavioural weight loss intervention with supervised exercise induced a weight loss of 5.0 ± 1.2 kg, while Change in weight, body composition, anthropometrics and fitness P-values contracted (unsupervised) exercise induced a weight loss of 3.8 ± 1.4 kg. However, physical activity participation data were not reported by, whereas these data are reported in the current study. Moreover, the current study reported that both STEP and UNSUP-PA had significantly more individuals achieving 5% weight loss compared to SUP-PA. It is unclear why STEP and UNSUP-PA had higher rates of individuals achieving 5% weight loss because physical activity and energy intake were not different between groups. Nonetheless, this is an intriguing finding that warrants further investigation.\nBoth UNSUP-PA and SUP-PA improved relative and absolute fitness more than STEP in response to this intervention. When comparing SUP-PA and UNSUP-PA, the results of the current study closely parallel those of Perri et al., which found that supervised exercise and home-based exercise improved relative VO 2 peak and absolute oxygen consumption after 6 months of training. While it is unclear why STEP did not improve absolute fitness, it is possible that there were differences in intensity or volume of physical activity compared to SUP-PA and UNSUP-PA that were not detectable with the measures used in this study.\nA unique contribution of this study was to compare a steps/day physical activity prescription (STEP) to both SUP-PA and UNSUP-PA. Objective physical activity data confirmed that STEP closely matched the step recommendations throughout the intervention and had similar changes in physical activity behaviours (i.e. SED, LPA and MVPA) compared to SUP-PA and UNSUP-PA. Because walking is an easy, safe and highly accessible form of physical activity, this finding has multiple public health implications. Physical activity in the form of walking and brisk walking may facilitate engagement in physical activity within the context of a standard behavioural weight loss intervention, and this may contribute to weight loss. Physical activity prescriptions in the form of steps/day recommendations maybe well received in the general population, especially with the influx of consumer physical activity devices available. Moreover, for individuals who prefer walking vs. other forms of physical activity, this study provides evidence that this form of physical activity is sufficient to elicit significant weight loss when combined with dietary change.\nThe limitations of this study should be considered when interpreting the observed results. This study was 12 weeks in duration, which may not represent the effectiveness of these different intervention strategies if observed fora longer period of time. Moreover, this study focused on initial weight loss rather than maintenance, so it will be necessary to determine if these strategies to increase physical activity have similar effects on Table Change in dietary intake P-values weight loss maintenance. Despite the participants selfreporting <60 min•week À1 of structured physical activity upon entry into this study, these participants were relatively more active than population averages based on objective assessment at study entry, which may have influenced the findings. Furthermore, this study may have been underpowered to detect meaningful clinical difference between the intervention conditions. This maybe a result of the sample size being based on the ability to detect a 20 min per week difference between groups, which may have been too small of a difference, or due to the higher than anticipated variance observed in objectively measured physical activity in this study. However, these data maybe valuable to inform future samples sizes in similar studies of physical activity.\n",

Within the context of a standard behavioural weight loss intervention, increased MVPA was also accompanied by significant reductions in body weight and favourable reductions in body fatness. Future studies that do not have the facilities or resources to conduct supervised physical activity sessions may benefit from prescribing physical activity in a similar unsupervised manner. Whether the results of this study will apply to interventions of longer duration or for other study populations warrants further investigation. However, this study provides compelling evidence that unsupervised physical activity, prescribed in minutes or steps, can elicit engagement in physical activity that is similar to supervised physical activity within the context of a comprehensive standard behavioural weight loss intervention in adults who are overweight or obese.\n",
