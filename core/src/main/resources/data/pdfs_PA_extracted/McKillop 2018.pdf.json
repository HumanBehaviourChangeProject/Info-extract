      "value": "Purpose: To assess a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to improve moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in adolescents with congenital heart disease. Methods: Intervention participants received one-on-one telephone-based adapted MI sessions over 3 months. Outcomes were acceptability, change mechanisms (stage of change and self-ef cacy), and limited ef cacy (physical activity, tness, and quality of life). Results: Thirty-six participants were randomized. Intervention participants completed 4.2 ± 1.2/6 MI sessions, with no improvements in the high self-ef cacy or stage of change observed. Participants accumulated 47.24 ± 16.36 minutes of MVPA/day, and had comparable outcomes to peers without heart disease (except for functional capacity). There was no signi cant difference in change in any outcome by group. Conclusions: The intervention was acceptable, but effectiveness could not be determined due to the nature and size of sample. Clinical Relevance: Pediatric cardiac rehabilitation remains the sole effective intervention to increase MVPA in this population. (Pediatr Phys Ther 2018;30:326-334) Key words: congenital heart disease, motivational interviewing, physical activity\nCongenital heart disease (CHD) occurs in 1% of all live births. 1 There are more than 120 000 adolescents living with CHD in the United States. Depending on the nature of their defects, adolescents with CHD often have impaired functional health status 3,4 and quality of life (QoL). 5 Exercise training is safe for adolescents with CHD, improving functional capacity and muscle strength, 6,7 leading to improved QoL. 8,9",

      "value": "Clinical practice guidelines for adolescents with CHD include recommendations for physical activity (PA), at levels that are appropriate for the most common cardiac defects. It is recommended that adolescents with CHD be physically active to a similar degree as the general population. The majority of adolescents with CHD are recommended to accumulate 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) daily.\nDespite these clinical recommendations, reports indicate that adolescents with CHD do not engage in suf cient PA. In some cases, degree of PA among patients with CHD is lower than that of peers. Limited PA in adolescents with CHD maybe attributed to parental overprotection, and lack of, or inconsistent, activity advice from healthcare providers. This could result in patient uncertainty regarding safe and appropriate activities, and ultimately lead to activity avoidance and sedentariness.\nInterventions to improve PA in this population include pediatric cardiac rehabilitation. However, these programs are not widely available, and barriers to participation in such supervised programs including transportation, distance, and time can be insurmountable in adolescents with CHD. One approach to behavior change, which does not need to be delivered faceto-face, is motivational interviewing (MI). MI takes a nonjudgmental, patient-centered approach to evoke, not impose, motivation aimed at resolving ambivalence. A meta-analysis of MI interventions targeting PA showed bene ts with modest effect sizes. There has been only one study that used MI to promote PA in adolescents with CHD ; however, it offered only one MI session in conjunction with a structured exercise program. There were signi cant increases in MVPA with intervention in the intervention group.\nConsidering the context of CHD in adolescence, published systematic reviews of exercise training interventions and PA guidelines for the CHD population, an adapted MI intervention delivered by telephone was developed to promote MVPA. The objectives of this pilot trial were to evaluate: (1) the implementation and acceptability of this adapted MI intervention (ie, adolescent adherence to sessions, effect on intended change mechanisms of self-ef cacy, and stage of change) and whether anew intervention has the capacity of being successful to improve PA, physical tness, and QoL in a controlled setting.\n",

A Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology-certi ed exercise physiologist prepared a 12-week, individualized exercise intervention for each participant determined by baseline physical tness (see assessments later), self-reported current activity participation, and information provided by the participant that could impact exercise intervention, for example, sport participation, work schedule, or religious commitments. The intervention progressively increased in frequency, intensity, and duration toward guideline-based PA recommendations for adolescents (60 minutes of daily MVPA). Consideration was given to the participant' s built environment, previous exercise experience, exercise interests, and personal schedule. A sample exercise intervention fora participant is available as Supplemental Digital Content 1 (available at: http://links.lww.com/PPT/A218).\nParticipants received 1 telephone call after 4 weeks and 1 telephone call after 8 weeks by the exercise physiologist to evaluate the need for modi cation to the intervention. Participants allocated to the comparison group did not receive additional contact beyond these calls.\nIntervention: Adapted Motivational Interviewing. In addition to receiving an individualized exercise intervention, participants allocated to the intervention group also participated in adapted MI sessions to explore and resolve ambivalence regarding PA. The intervention was designed to focus on behavior and intrinsic motivation, to be collaborative in delivery, and was aimed at advancing stages of change and increasing exercise self-ef cacy. Key MI principles were used during each session as appropriate, including autonomy, empathy, re ective listening, summaries, and open-ended questions. The intervention took into consideration participants' life stage as an adolescent, and their growing independence and hence requirement for self-management skills.\nThe intervention consisted of biweekly sessions by telephone over the 3-month period (ie, 6 sessions). The rst session aimed to build rapport with the participant, understand their current views about exercise and self-reported activity level. The importance of PA in their life and their perceived con dence to change behavior were assessed, and advantages and disadvantages of making a change were explored. Subsequent sessions built upon the previous session(s) with progression toward building a reasonable plan with the participant that would increase their MVPA. Where appropriate and with their permission, information or suggestions were provided to participants regarding exercise techniques based on their progress with the exercise intervention. An outline of the adapted MI sessions is available as Supplemental Digital Content 2 (available at: http://links.lww.com/PPT/A219).\nOne investigator received training from the MI Network of Trainers during a 2-weekend training course. Supervised practice sessions were completed following the training course, where individualized feedback was provided from MI trainers and peers.\n",

First, to test the implementation and acceptability of the intervention, the number of completed sessions and the duration of each session were recorded.\nTo test whether the intervention had the intended mechanistic effect, stage of change and self-ef cacy were assessed in all participants at pre-and posttest via self-report survey. The Readiness to Change questionnaire is a 4-item survey that was administered to assess the participant' s motivation to change PA. It has been validated in a pediatric sample. Scores range from 0 to 4, with each value representing the following stages, respectively: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. The Self-Ef cacy Scale for Physical Activity was administered. This scale consists of 9 items with total scores ranging from 0-90, with higher scores denoting greater self-ef cacy. It has been administered in children and adolescents with CHD with good psychometric performance.\nParticipants were invited to complete the following outcome assessments at baseline and during their posttest visit: PA, physical tness indicators, and QoL. These were to test limited ef cacy, to support the decision whether to proceed to a full-scale trial and, if yes, potential sample and effect size estimation.\nPA. Participants were provided an Actigraph wGT3X-Plus Triaxial Activity Monitor (Actilife, Pensacola, Florida). It is a valid and reliable measure of treadmill walking at known speed and an audible shaker. The accelerometer was to be worn over the right hip during waking hours for 7 days (2 weekend days and 5 weekdays), except when bathing or swimming. Participants were provided with a logbook to record the dates and times they wore the monitor to substantiate data where ambiguous.\nAccelerometer data were included where a minimum of 3 valid (ie, minimum wear time of 10 hours/day) days of data was received. PA intensity was categorized using cut-point conventions by Evenson and colleagues. (sedentary = 0-100 counts per minute [cpm]; light = 101-2295 cpm; moderate = 2296-4011 cpm; vigorous = ≥4012 cpm). Minutes per day were averaged at each intensity, and the mean minutes of MVPA per day computed. The primary endpoint was changed in MVPA from pre-to posttest.\nPhysical Fitness Indicators. Anthropometric measures included standing height and body weight (to compute body mass index; BMI = kg/m 2 ), as well as waist circumference (average of 2 measurements taken at the narrowest point above the iliac crest). Aerobic tness was assessed using the validated Modi ed Canadian Aerobic Fitness Test. Participants were asked to take alternating steps to a set cadence from an audio cue to estimate oxygen consumption; exibility (sit and reach), muscular strength (grip strength), and muscular endurance (partial curl-up) were also assessed using standard protocols. This collection of tests was selected as it has been previously administered in a representative sample of adolescents as part of the Canadian Health Measures Survey. These data were used as a comparator to interpret the results in this study.\nQoL. Global and health-related QoL were assessed via selfreported surveys. A visual analog scale was administered to assess global QoL. The anchors were 0 to represent \"worst possible QoL\" and continued to a value of 100 to represent \"best possible QoL.\" Dimensions of health-related QoL were assessed using the 23-item Pediatric QoL Inventory (PedsQL) Teen (13-18) Report. Scores for items in each of 4 domains (physical, emotional, social, and school; range 0-100 for each) were used to calculate total health-related QoL, with higher scores denoting greater QoL.\n",

      "value": "It is well-established that PA is associated with improved functional status and positive psychosocial outcomes in adolescents and those with CHD, although some mixed ndings are reported. This study tested the acceptability, implementation, and limited ef cacy of a theory-based intervention to improve MVPA in adolescents with CHD. The intervention was fairly well received, with only a 10% dropout and 70% adherence to sessions. While not powered to observe an effect on outcomes, results did not support the intervention. However, this study is one of few that assessed functional tness among other objective indicators in adolescents with CHD. The MVPA and physical tness of patients in this study were comparable to those of healthy peers, except functional capacity was quite low and one-quarter of participants were overweight or obese.\nWhile the sample size for this pilot study was small, the adapted MI intervention had no discernible effect onstage of change or self-ef cacy for PA as intended, and hence not surprisingly had no effect on outcomes (and in fact may have tended to have a negative effect on vigorous-intensity PA). The lack of effect of this intervention could be attributed to several factors, including the high degree of PA and exercise self-ef cacy at baseline and that most participants were in the maintenance phase (ie, selection bias), the adaptation of MI, intervention delivery via telephone rather than in-person, or characteristics of the sole counselor. Patients may have not considered the intervention to be important, as they engaged PA levels similar to healthy peers at baseline, which was almost 80% of recommended levels. Finally, the provision of an exercise intervention and 2 calls with the exercise physiologist in the comparison group may have diminished any intervention effect; the intervention itself as delivered was a total of 60 minutes only over and above these 2 calls (4/6 [67%] planned calls at 15 minutes each on average). The optimal intervention approach (ie, method of delivery and number of sessions) for inactive adolescents with CHD remains unknown and should be explored in future studies.\nThe average minutes of MVPA per day of patients with CHD in this study was comparable to published values of healthy children (53 minutes of MVPA for males and 47 minutes of MVPA for females aged 15-19 years). While the sample in this study may have been more active than the average adolescent with CHD, as they were interested in an exercise study, these results corroborate that adolescents with CHD may not be less active than their healthy peers. Voss and colleagues assessed PA via accelerometry among patients with various CHD   Patients in this study accumulated relatively similar sedentary minutes as their healthy peers (590 min/d vs 554 min/d). This sedentary behavior, representing approximately 74% of their time, was also similar to that reported in patients with CHD (70%).\nThis study demonstrated favorable psychosocial health among adolescents with CHD. Patients were con dent they could be physically active and reported relatively high QoL. The high proportion of patients with simple CHD may have contributed to the high values, and collectively contribute to the high PA participation observed in our study.\nPediatric cardiac rehabilitation should continue to serve as an important venue to promote PA in children and adolescents with CHD. The bene cial effects of these programs on exercise capacity, psychosocial outcomes, and PA have been reviewed previously. Serious adverse events have not been reported. Perhaps by intervening earlier in this population and over a longer period, with those who have lower PA and self-ef cacy, lifelong PA habits can be ingrained, resulting in better physical and psychosocial outcomes. Unfortunately, there are few such programs available; broader delivery could be achieved by offering homebased services as is available in adult programs. This could also address some of the barriers to adhering to the intervention and MVPA reported by participants in this study.\nPhysical therapists are well-positioned to deliver pediatric cardiac rehabilitation programs, as well as provide exercise and behavior change interventions, given their in-depth understanding of chronic conditions like CHD. Furthermore, community-based physical therapists maybe integral to support home-based programs and delivery of behavioral interventions like MI for patients with CHD where they cannot readily access a center.\nCaution is warranted when interpreting these results. First with regard to generalizability, this study was limited to a single institution. Also related to generalizability limits, is that the sample was an active group already in the \"maintenance\" stage. Due to this selection bias, it is warranted that the intervention is tested in an adequately powered inactive cohort before conclusions on ef cacy are drawn.\nSecond and related, given this was a pilot study, the sample was small and the lack of intervention effect could be due to low power. The sample size was also reduced due to low retention. This may have introduced bias, particularly considering there were fewer females with valid accelerometer data than males.\nThird, with regard to design, the outcome assessor was not blind to condition, and this may have biased the results. Fourth, with regard to analysis, they were not undertaken on the basis of intention to treat. However, with regard to limitations 3 and 4, given the lack of demonstrated intervention effect, these are not a major concern.\n",
