      "value": "Objective. Few postpartum ethnic minority women perform leisure-time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The study tested the effectiveness of a 12-month tailored intervention to increase MVPA in women with infants 2-12 months old.\nMethods. From 2008 to 2011, women (n = 311) with infants (average age = 5.7 months) from Honolulu, Hawaii were randomly assigned to receive tailored telephone calls and access to a mom-centric website (n = 154) or access to a standard PA website (n = 157). MVPA was measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months using self-report and acclerometers.\nResults. Controlling for covariates, the tailored condition significantly increased self-reported MVPA from an average of 44 to 246 min/week compared with 46 to 156 min/week for the standard condition (p = 0.027). Mothers with ≥ 2 children had significantly greater increases in MVPA in response to the tailored intervention than those with one child (p = 0.016). Accelerometer-measured MVPA significantly increased overtime (p = 0.0001), with no condition differences. There was evidence of reactivity to initially wearing accelerometers; the tailored intervention significantly increased MVPA among women with low baseline accelerometer MVPA minutes, but not among those with high minutes (p interaction = 0.053).\nA tailored intervention effectively increased MVPA over 12 months in multiethnic women with infants, particularly those with more than one child.",

      "value": "Previous studies have shown that women with children are less active than their same aged female peers without children, and that there are significant changes in health behaviors, including reductions in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), during the postpartum period. These changes place this vulnerable population at risk for weight gain and development of chronic health conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes.\nRecent studies have tested the effectiveness of leisure-time physical activity (PA) interventions, alone or in combination with dietary change/weight loss in postpartum women 214-223 ☆ The study sponsor, NIH-NCI, had no role in study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing the report; or the decision to submit the report for publication.. However, few PA interventions have intervened only on PA, with just three studies focusing primarily on ethnic minority postpartum women, most of whom were African-Americans or Hispanics. Several studies were short-term (b 6 months) leaving longer term (12-month) interventions untested. Therefore, little is known about the effectiveness of PA interventions with ethnic minorities including Asian-Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders (AA and NHOPI). This is important because the number of AA and NHOPI living in Hawaii is 981,129 (72.1% of the population) and, across the U.S., is over 16 million. This is estimated to increase to 47 million by 2060.\nSince new mothers are high-end users of technology, PA interventions are needed that can effectively combine technology and tailored counseling to promote the initiation of MVPA during a time when substantial developmental changes occur in an infant. Telephone and internet interventions have effectively increased PA in a range of populations. Building on previous research, a PA intervention tailored to meet the needs of multiethnic mothers of infants less than 12 months of age was designed. This study compared the effectiveness of two, 12-month technologybased PA interventions designed to increase MVPA in postpartum women. One was a theoretically-derived multi-component PA intervention using constructs previously proven to be effective in PA interventions. The other intervention used a 'standard' PA website as a comparison. We hypothesized that the tailored intervention would significantly increase MVPA more than the standard intervention, as measured by surveys and accelerometers.\n",

Participants in this condition were referred to a condition-specific tailored website, and received 17 telephone calls with a counselor who used motivational interviewing techniques to problem-solve barriers and set future PA goals (incrementally building up to 150 min/week of MVPA). They were issued a pedometer (New Lifestyles NL-1000) to track and set goals using steps (with goal of 10,000 steps a day). Tailored mom-centric PA \"resource directories\" and newsletters were key components of the website. Both the written information (website/newsletters) and the telephone counseling calls were developed/delivered using Resnicow's framework for creating culturally sensitive interventions which revolves around two dimensions: surface structure and deep structure. The intervention's use of surface structure included external representations of AA and NHOPI in Hawaii (e.g., artwork/photos depicting Asian/NHOPI women and infants), and for deep structure the ethnically matched counselors were knowledgeable and respectful of the Native Hawaiian's cultural values of family (or 'ohana) and Japanese cultural values of social harmony and interdependence within the family.\nA majority (70%) of TTCW women received 13 or more calls, and the average duration of the calls was 12.7 (SD = 6.4) min.

Participants wore the device for 7 days (during waking hours) at each time point. The Lifecorder EX device recorded time spent at proprietary intensity levels (microactivity and levels 1-9) in 4 second and 2 minute epochs. Lifecorder's level 4 was previously estimated to have a MET equivalence of 2.9, and was selected as our cutoff for MVPA that is generally defined as MET ≥ 3.0. Thus, MVPA was computed as time spent at Lifecorder levels 4-9, averaged across valid days. Valid days were defined as 10 h per day of wear, excluding bouts of zero activity that were 20 minor longer, which were considered periods when the device was not worn. The minimum number of valid days for inclusion in the analysis was three or more, whereat least one was a weekend day.\n",

      "value": "The primary analyses (conducted 2011-2013) compared change in minutes of MVPA from baseline to 12 months in the two conditions using an intention to treat strategy. Outcome measures were transformed based on the Box-Cox method to better meet model assumptions. Self-reported MVPA weighted for intensity was transformed as (y + 1) to the 0.25 power. The accelerometer MVPA data were not transformed. Mixed linear growth models were used to estimate and compare differences in MVPA overtime between conditions. These models, also called random coefficient models, include random linear trends (intercept and slope terms) for each individual and fixed terms for intercept and slope for each condition (via main effect and interaction terms) estimating the overall expected value, as well as fixed effects for covariates. The treatment effect was assessed by the F test of the fixed interaction parameter for time and intervention group. Models were run with and without adjustment for covariates selected a priori. Adjustment variables included: age, race, BMI, number of children, education level, full-time employment, Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, baby's age, history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), source of recruitment, and number of years lived in Hawaii. The effect size was calculated by taking the differences between the means at month 12 predicted from the adjusted model, divided by the standard deviation for the difference computed from the within and between subject variance components. Additionally, moderation was tested in the mixed growth model by the F-test for three-way interaction terms between time, study condition, and potential moderators (including the adjustment variables and baseline PA level); the model included all two-way interaction terms.\nAbout one-quarter of women who were randomized did not provide information by survey on MVPA at 12 months, and this differed by condition (18% for SWO and 32% for TTCW). Thirty-seven percent of women did not provide accelerometer data at months, which was not different by condition. Model results are presented using all available data (includes women with at least one MVPA measurement and all covariates at baseline). However, analyses were conducted to address attrition and missing outcome data. Correlates of attrition, identified using a stepwise logistic model, were the TTCW treatment condition, younger age and higher BMI for the survey data, and younger age, higher BMI, Hawaiian race and lower education for the accelerometry data. The impact of missing MVPA data on the validity of study results was assessed for the survey data, but not for the accelerometer data due to the greater extent and nondifferential nature of the missing data. First, a pattern mixture model was used to compare the treatment effect between those who completed assessments and those who did not. Multiple imputation (MI) was then performed separately by experimental condition, accounting for all adjustment variables and variables related to attrition. Results were aggregated using standard MI techniques across 10 data sets.\nAnalyses were primarily conducted using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary NC), and Mplus, version 6.

The effect size for the difference at 12 months was 0.36. The findings were not markedly biased by differential attrition.

Models using multiple imputation (n = 311) and complete cases (n = 231, with baseline and 12 month MVPA data and all covariates) yielded similar results (Supplementary Table).\nThe analysis of possible moderators of the change in self-reported MVPA found that the number of children was significant (p = 0.016, Table). Among women with 2 or more children, MVPA increased by min/week in the TTCW condition, and by 89 min/week in the SWO condition.

      "value": "The Nā Mikimiki Project compared the effectiveness of two 12-month PA interventions, both of which had online components. The tailored intervention included 17 telephone counseling calls when MVPA goals were set and barriers were resolved. As hypothesized, the 12-month increase in self-reported MVPA was significantly greater in the tailored telephone counseling intervention (202 min/week) over the 12 month intervention, than in the website only condition (110 min/wk). Conversely, the accelerometry MVPA showed increases over the 12 month period (from 163 to 215 min/wk for TTCW and 162 to 203 min/wk for SWO), but condition differences were not statistically significant.\nDue to differences in study samples (e.g., race/ethnicity, BMI, and age of infant), length of the PA intervention, intervention methods (e.g., group-based versus home-based PA), study outcomes (weight loss versus PA alone) and methods for assessing MPVA, it is difficult to directly compare this study's findings with those of previous studies with postpartum women. However, two previous PA interventions\nwith postpartum ethnic minority women, over a comparable time period, reported non-significant increases in PA. Thus, this study's significant differential increase in self-reported MVPA fora 12-month tailored MVPA telephone plus website intervention represents a unique finding for postpartum women with infants. Several other studies with postpartum women have reported similar between-group differences in minutes/week of MVPA following a PA intervention, but their interventions were shorter (i.e., 8-12 weeks) or used supervised PA classes. This study successfully recruited 311 postpartum women but had difficulty with retention and completion of study assessments, largely due to participants becoming pregnant. Seventy percent of women in the TTCW condition received most (76%) of the planned telephone contacts over 12 months.

The interaction effect was assessed by the F-test of the 3-way interaction parameter for characteristic level, time, and study condition. The relevant main and interaction parameters (in units of MVPA minutes + 1, to the 0.25 power) for the overall model are as follows: 0.077 (SE = 0.011, p b 0.0001) for time in months, 0.025 (SE = 0.120, p = 0.84) for condition and 0.036 (SE = 0.016, p = 0.027) for the time and condition interaction.\nc Other group excluded in comparison.\n12-month evaluations of TTCW's helpfulness and satisfaction with its components were very high (see Appendix A), the number of repeat visits to the website was suboptimal, particularly among the TTCW participants after the first 2-3 months of the intervention. The TTCW website was updated regularly with a list of local events appropriate for new mothers with infants or other children, so new information was available overtime. However, the two condition-specific websites were not formatted fora Smartphone, so participants may have found accessing them via a desktop/laptop inconvenient as their infants became mobile. Future online interventions' text/photos/videos should be formatted so they are easily viewed on a Smartphone. Although the Nā Mikimiki Project's sample was similar to postpartum samples reported in previous PA intervention studies with respect to age of mother, marital status, percent primiparous, and average number of children, the proportion of ethnic minority women (85%) was higher than in two studies that included African American postpartum women (Mothers in Motion (MIM = 52%) and Active Mothers Postpartum (AMP = 45%). Other socio-demographic factors that differed across these studies were lactation rates, women's employment status, BMI and infant's age. Some of these socio-demographic characteristics were controlled for in these studies' analyses; however, the adjustment was not consistent across studies and moderator analyses were not consistently reported. Although our sample consisted of several culturally distinct races in sufficient numbers (white, Japanese, Filipino, Asian mixed, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders, and more than one ethnicity/race), race was not a significant moderator of the increase in MVPA. None of the three previous PA intervention studies with postpartum women that included African-American or Hispanic women reported differences by race/ethnicity in their PA outcomes. Therefore, it appears that when a MVPA intervention is culturally sensitive and carefully tailored to meet the needs of its population, participants respond equally well across race/ ethnic groups.\nIn any long-term study, retention is a key component in the interpretation of a study's results. The proportion of the Na Mikimiki sample that completed multiple follow-up surveys over 12 months was comparable to the rates reported by, with pregnancy being a primary reason for loss-to-follow-up in both studies.  b Treatment effect was assessed by a mixed growth model and the F test of the fixed 2-way interaction parameter for time and study condition for overall and of the 3-way interaction parameter for characteristic level, time, and study condition. The relevant main and interaction parameters (in units of MVPA minutes) for the overall model are as follows: 3.562 (SE = 0.849, p b 0.0001) for time in months, 0.388 (SE = 9.522, p = 0.97) for condition and 0.648 (SE = 1.258, p = 0.61) for the time and condition interaction.\nc Other group excluded in comparison.\nAn interesting finding was that women with 2 or more children responded better to the TTCW intervention than those with one child; however, there were no differences between these two groups in the time spent on the telephone with the counselor (p = 0.83). The ability of women with two or more children to increase their MVPA, more than those with one child, could reflect better time management skills, or being more secure in their role as a mother and not \"feeling guilty\" if they spent time on themselves for PA.\nThe results from the self-reported data and accelerometer data differed for MVPA; the subjective measure confirmed the hypothesis, while the objective measure did not. The difference could be due to several factors, including recall bias for the surveys and reactivity caused by the accelerometer. The latter is more likely as the women in this study reported performing little MVPA on the survey. Yet, the levels registered by the accelerometer at baseline suggested that they were physically active. Also, the mean MVPA min/week was very similar for the two methodologies at months when the novelty of the accelerometer would have subsided. This was confirmed by the fact that among women below the median for PA accelerometer level at baseline, the TTCW condition exhibited a greater change in PA than the SWO condition, while this was not true for the women above the median (p = 0.053). Comparing results that used different types of evidence calls to attention the important differences between measurement methods. For example, women would likely perceive walking while pushing a stroller or walking with the baby in a shoulder-strap carrier as moderate-vigorous activity. Objective measures of energy expenditure confirm the accuracy of this perception. However, the accelerometer would count this activity as 'light' because of the lower velocity/acceleration, without accounting for added effort when the user is pushing or carrying a heavy object. This illustrates the importance of multiple indicators of PA when assessing intervention effectiveness to capture the complexity of PA. Conclusions on the effectiveness of an intervention using a single methodology may miss important related outcomes.\n",

      "value": "Since the Nā Mikimiki sample included a high proportion of married women with relatively high educational achievement (78% college educated), the results may not be generalizable to women from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Also, given that the sample consisted of women who were interested in becoming more active, they may have been more receptive to the intervention than other postpartum women. Another limitation was that, by 12 months, loss-to follow-up was 25% for the surveys and 37% for the accelerometers. Also, attrition tended to be differential; perhaps because of the commitment involved; this could have led to biased results. However, results from several types of sensitivity analyses verified that patterns of missing data did not bias the results. Also the correlates of attrition in our study are similar to those found in other exercise interventions and weight loss interventions involving physical activity, which include age, education, and a higher BMI. Nonetheless, future physical activity interventions should make every effort to retain participants with, for example, a higher BMI at baseline, by including strategies/messages that directly address issues important to this subgroup (i.e., being physically active is important regardless of how much you weigh or whether you are trying to lose weight or not). Also, lower retention rates for ethnic minorities in randomized clinical trials area concern; however, we used several strategies that have been shown to maximize retention in clinical trials (i.e., establishing rapport, participants' perception of the study as informative, etc.). Further studies are needed on the sustainability of the behavior changes achieved. A further limitation is that the separate treatment effects attributable to the mom-tailored website and the attention due to the tailored telephone counseling calls cannot be distinguished because the TTCW intervention was designed to include both the online and telephone elements.\n",
