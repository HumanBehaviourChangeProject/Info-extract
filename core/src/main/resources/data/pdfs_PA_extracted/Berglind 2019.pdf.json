      "value": "Background: Adequate levels of physical activity (PA) and good cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with profound health benefits for individuals with mobility disability (MD). Despite the vast amount of research published in the field of PA interventions, little attention has been given to individuals with MD.\nThe aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of an app-based versus a supervised exercise and health coaching program to support adults with MD to increase levels of PA, CRF, and improve body composition.\nMethods: Participants with self-perceived MD, aged 18 to 45 years, were included in this 12-week parallel-group randomized controlled trial and allocated at random to an app-based intervention, using commercially available apps-the Swedish Military training app (FMTK), the Acupedo walking app, and the LogMyFood food photography app-or a supervised exercise and health coaching intervention, including 1 weekly supervised exercise session and healthy lifestyle coaching. The primary outcome was the level of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) measured with accelerometers. Secondary outcomes included CRF measured by a submaximal test performed on a stationary bicycle and body composition measured by bioelectrical impedance. All outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Linear mixed-effect models were used to assess the between-group differences, as well as the within-group changes through time, in each intervention group.\nResults: A total of 110 participants with MD were randomized to an app-based intervention (n=55) or a supervised exercise and health intervention (n=55). The mean age of participants was 34.9 years (SD 6.1), and 81.8% (90/110) of the participants were women. CRF showed a moderate increase in both groups after 12 weeks-1.07 (95% CI -0.14 to 2.27) mL/kg/min increase in the app-based group and 1.76 (95% CI 0.70 to 2.83) mLkg/min increase in the supervised exercise group. However, the intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant differences between the groups in MVPA or CRF after 12 weeks. Waist circumference was significantly lower in the app-based intervention group.\nCommercially available apps increased levels of CRF and improved body composition over 12 weeks to the same extent as supervised exercise sessions, showing that both are equally effective. However, neither the app-based intervention nor the supervised exercise intervention increased MVPA.",

      "value": "In Sweden, approximately 23% of the population, between 16 and 84 years of age, reports some kind of disability, whereas 8% of the population suffers from mobility disability (MD), limiting their participation in society and ability to work. Health-related and social welfare costs for individuals with disabilities are the fastest growing expenditure by municipality in Sweden, and this represents 1.6% of the Swedish gross domestic product. Often, individuals with MD suffer from social and health inequalities related to their condition, such as impaired access to healthcare services or social programs, lower employment rates, and higher risk of chronic diseases.\nAlthough there are many known health benefits of physical activity (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), such as reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and improvement in markers of metabolic health, young adults with MD are less likely to engage in PA compared with their able-bodied peers. In addition, obesity has been shown to be both a risk factor and a consequence of MD, and observational studies have shown that individuals with MD are not only more likely to suffer from obesity, but they are also more likely to be negatively impacted by its consequences.\nDespite the vast amount of research published in the field of PA interventions over the past decades, little attention has been given to interventions aiming to increase PA and CRF among individuals with MD. Nevertheless, interventions focusing on PA and CRF for those with MD maybe of particular importance, as there is evidence indicating that PA and CRF can confer additional health benefits for people with MD compared with the general population. Additional evidence for the importance of high CRF in young adulthood comes from a recent prospective study, showing that higher CRF in young adulthood is associated with lower risk for receipt of a disability pension (from, eg, musculoskeletal causes) later in life, in a dose-response manner across all BMI categories. To date, PA interventions targeting individuals with MD are limited to labor-intense supervised health programs targeting the elderly.\nThe few existing studies on PA and MD indicate that motivation for PA is high among individuals with MD and that barriers to PA engagement primarily include accessibility to tailored PA and alack of knowledge on how to engage in PA. Moreover, there is evidence that autonomy, goal setting, surveillance, support, and feedback are important factors for improving and maintaining healthy levels of PA in young adults with MD. Consequently, factors beyond health benefits maybe important to target when intervening on levels of PA and CRF in individuals with MD. Given that many people have busy lifestyles but still value access to health behavior programs that provide advice, information, feedback, and self-monitoring around the clock, app-based programs maybe an attractive approach. A recent meta-analysis showed modest evidence for effectiveness of smartphone apps to increase PA in the short term (up to 3 months). However, there is an inconsistency in the literature on the effects from multicomponent versus app-based PA interventions on health outcomes. A preventive app-based PA intervention targeting individuals with MD has the potential to improve levels of PA, CRF, and the general health in this vulnerable group, to avert the progression to more severe disabilities and comorbidities and to thus reduce social and healthcare inequalities.\n",

      "value": "Current systematic review data indicate that app-based interventions to improve PA can be effective and that multicomponent interventions appear to be more effective than stand-alone app interventions. However, there is alack of randomized trials, and most previous studies have included older populations or relied on self-reported measures of PA. The discrepancy between self-reported and objectively measured PA is well established, and several app-based PA intervention studies show substantial increases in self-reported PA but not objectively (accelerometer) measured PA. This lack of uniformity, in combination with the inaccuracy of self-reported data as a measure of PA, makes it difficult to compare and summarize outcomes across PA interventions.\nPA interventions, using objective measures of PA, targeting individuals with MD are scarce. The LIFE intervention randomized 1635 sedentary 70-to 89-year-old men and women with MD to an exercise program, with supervised exercise 2 times per week and home-based exercise 3 to 4 times per week, or to a health educator program comprising workshops on topics relevant to older adults. Through 2 years of follow-up, participants in the exercise group participated in an additional 40 min of light-intensity PA per week, assessed by accelerometry, compared with the health educator group. The between-group differences in self-reported PA were 104 min per week. This discrepancy between self-reported and objectively measured PA further highlights the importance to incorporate objective measures when evaluating the effectiveness of PA interventions. Transferability of results from the LIFE study to this study is limited for several reasons. The LIFE study included an older population and did not assess time in MVPA or CRF, which has shown stronger associations to health outcomes in isotemporal substitution studies compared with LPA.\nMeta-analysis data, including 12 RCTs, show that 3 aerobic/strength exercise sessions per week, for 30 to 60 min per session, can increase VO 2 max by approximately 2.3 mL/kg/min. Furthermore, supervised exercise 3 times per week has shown to increase VO 2 max by approximately 6% over 12 weeks in adults. This is somewhat comparable with the 2.5 mL/kg/min (7%) increase in VO 2 max seen in this study, with only 1 supervised 60-min aerobic/strength exercise session per week.\n",

      "value": "Although the changes in PA were inconclusive, the changes in CRF (1.3 and 2.5 mL/min/kg increases in VO 2 max for the app group and supervised exercise group, respectively) may translate into substantial long-term health benefits. In fact, a 1 mL/min/kg increase in VO 2 max is associated with a 9% relative risk reduction of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI 0.87 to 0.95), which is a similar effect as a 10 cm reduction in waist circumference or a 10 mm/Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure. Even though PA has effects on mortality independent of CRF, the opposite also holds true. This further highlights the importance of the CRF improvements seen in this study. In addition, both protocols reduced waist circumference, fat mass, and BMI over weeks, which are all important markers of health.\nAt baseline, participants in both groups had a slightly higher VO 2 max and were substantially more active (>80% of the participants meeting the PA recommendations) compared with the general Swedish population. This may, to some extent, explain why participants in both groups did not increase PA over the intervention period. Moreover, as further discussed in the Strengths and Limitations section, the high levels of PA at baseline may limit generalizability of findings in this study to the general population with MD.\nThe app intervention was designed to be simple for widespread implementation in a variety of communities and settings, as it requires no special equipment or previous exercise knowledge. Although apps have the potential to increase the reach of health behavior change interventions, our results mirror the recent research showing that few individuals will use an offered app consistently overtime. Surprisingly, those who used the app ≥5 times/week did not show greater changes in any measured variables, from baseline to 12 weeks, compared with those who used the apps less frequently. Instead, the per-protocol analyses showed that those who used the apps more frequently had higher baseline levels of CRF and lower fat mass and BMI; thus, there was less room for improvements.\n",

      "value": "A major strength of this study was the use of an RCT design to determine the effect of the use of commercially available apps compared with supervised exercise. Use of the apps during the intervention was ad libitum and not closely monitored, which reflects real-life app use, and contact with participants in the app group was minimal to reflect a real-world context and therefore increase generalizability. Furthermore, the primary and secondary outcomes were measured with objective measurements, in accordance with current recommendations, which further adds to the study's internal validity. Unlike the high attrition rate commonly observed in PA interventions, follow-up assessments were completed for 80% of participants, which represents a fairly high retention rate. As the study participants were aware of the study when they performed the baseline measurements of PA, it is most likely that they were more physically active than usual, which limits the comparison of baseline and outcome for PA measures. However, the CRF measures are reliable from baseline.\nSome limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, as participants were self-recruited from the community, they may not be fully representative of all people with MD, as shown by the high baseline levels of PA among the participants. Using free apps, instead of paid apps, may have increased contamination and/or cointerventions. There are also some limitations regarding our data collection. The participants began the intervention between December and May. Thus, changes in weather condition might have affected the levels of PA. However, there are data indicating that accelerometer-measured levels of PA may not be significantly affected by seasonality in populations living in high latitudes, such as Sweden. In addition, we considered all valid MVPA observations from participants who provided 4 or more days of valid accelerometer data without considering the difference between weekdays and weekends. Both issues might introduce some bias in our analysis which, assuming successful randomization, would underestimate the effect of the intervention increasing the chance of type 2 error. Furthermore, the use of readily available apps precluded access to data on app utilization (we used self-reported data on app use).\nThe higher dropout in the app group (n=16), compared with the supervised exercise group (n=6), limited the statistical power to detect between-group differences. The initial power calculations were based on at least 40 participants, with measures on the primary outcome MVPA, in each group (n=39 in the app group at 12 weeks). However, 44% of the dropouts in the app group occurred directly after the randomization process because of dissatisfaction with the group allocation. Finally, the lack of a passive control group made it impossible to draw conclusions on whether apps can improve PA and CRF compared with not using apps. However, as stated in the aim of the study, the hypothesis of the study was to test to what extent commercially available apps can provide effects on PA and CRF compared with supervised exercise.\n",
