      "value": "The America on the Move (AOM) Family Intervention Program has been shown to prevent excess weight gain in overweight children. Providing intervention materials via the internet would have the potential to reach more families but may increase sedentary behavior. The purpose was to evaluate whether delivering the AOM Family Intervention via the internet versus printed workbook would have a similar impact on sedentary behaviors in children. Methods: 131 children (age 8-12) were randomized to receive the AOM Family Intervention via the internet or workbook for 12 weeks. Changes in objectively measured sedentary time and moderate-to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as well as self-reported screen time were compared between groups. Results: There were no signi cant differences between groups in screen time, sedentary time, or MVPA at the end of the 12 week intervention. Families receiving the intervention via the internet were more likely to remain in the study (98% vs. 82%, P = .016). Conclusions: Using the internet to deliver the lifestyle intervention did not increase sedentary behavior in children. Attrition rates were lower when the program was delivered by internet versus via printed materials. These results provide support for using the internet to deliver healthy lifestyle programs for children.",

      "value": "Despite widespread awareness of the problem of obesity and its consequences, and despite increasing efforts to address the problem, obesity rates remain high. The increase in childhood obesity observed in the 1980s and 1990s is particularly alarming, as it is paralleled by an increase in the prevalence of weight-related medical problems previously unheard of in children including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, fatty liver disease, pulmonary complications (eg, asthma, sleep apnea), and musculoskeletal problems. The prevalence of obesity in US children and adolescents ages 2-19 currently approaches 17%. Although recent data suggests obesity rates in children maybe stabilizing in females and preadolescent males there remains a critical need for effective programs to begin to reverse the high rates of childhood obesity.\nAlthough there is agreement about the urgent need to address the epidemic of obesity in children, there is not agreement about how to do this. Many experts believe we may have more success in preventing obesity than in reversing it once it is established. Hill et al suggested that a strategy of preventing excessive weight gain maybe more feasible than a strategy of weight reduction for the entire population. Data from Wang et al found that excessive weight gain in children seems to be attributable, on average, to an extra 630 kJ/day (150 kcal/day), suggesting that small lifestyle changes can be used to prevent excessive weight gain in children and adolescents as well.\nThe importance and effectiveness of family-based childhood overweight prevention programs has been demonstrated in several studies, and experts have recommended a family-based approach as the best way to address excessive weight in children. As a result, The America On the Move Foundation (AOM) has created a program that helps Americans prevent excessive weight gain, via 1) reducing energy intake by 420 kJ/day (100 kcal/day) and 2) increasing physical activity (walking) by 2000 steps per day. We have shown in 2 studies that the AOM program is effective in preventing excessive weight gain in families with at least 1 child who was overweight or at risk for overweight. The results of these studies suggest that emphasizing small changes, when provided as a family intervention, can help to reduce excessive weight gain in children who are overweight or at risk for overweight.\nIn our earlier studies, the AOM Family program was delivered primarily via a printed, self-guided, stepby-step workbook provided to the families. In each weekly workbook chapter, families and kids were given activities, games and/or recipes to encourage healthy lifestyles. The workbook also contained a step goal to accomplish each week. We are currently interested in providing the AOM Family Program in an internet based format. The proliferation of the internet provides a powerful mechanism to widen the reach of interventions in children. In 2009, 93% of US children had access to a computer at home. An internet format would allow the AOM Family program to be more widely available to interested participants and to be provided in a more cost effective manner.\nHowever, providing an intervention via an internet based format could have unintended negative consequences by leading to increases in computer usage. Internet and computer use are increasingly common leisure-time activities in children which have the potential to impact negatively on health by increasing sedentary time and decreasing physical activity. While a small increase in computer time is expected when an intervention is delivered via an internet format, it is possible that providing an intervention via the internet could serve as a \"gateway\" to increased computer use. For example once a child logs onto the computer to participate in the internet based intervention, they might be more likely to engage in other activities on the computer which could increase overall sedentary behavior with potential adverse health effects. Increased computer use could also displace time spent in leisure time physical activity. While a number of studies have evaluated the ef cacy of internet based interventions for promoting physical activity behavior in children, no studies we are aware of have evaluated the impact of internet based interventions on sedentary time in children. For this reason, we felt it would be important to evaluate whether providing a healthy lifestyle intervention via the internet could lead to detrimental changes in sedentary behavior. Our ultimate goal was to address the possibility that using a sedentary technique (the internet) to promote physical activity could be counterproductive.\nTherefore, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether providing the AOM family intervention in an internet based format as compared with the traditional printed workbook format would impact sedentary behaviors in both overweight and normal weight children. We chose to include both normal weight and overweight children in the study as the AOM as the aim of the AOM program is to prevent excess weight gain and reduce risk of becoming overweight in normal weight children, as well as reduce further weight gain in already overweight and obese children. A secondary aim was to evaluate whether providing the AOM family intervention in an internet based format as compared with a printed workbook format would impact objectively measured time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in both overweight and normal weight children. We hypothesized that providing the AOM family intervention in an internet based format as compared with the traditional printed workbook format would not have a detrimental impact on either sedentary behavior or physical activity in overweight and normal weight children.\n",

Families in both groups were asked to make 2 small lifestyle changes consisting of 1) increasing daily walking by 4000 steps/ day above baseline levels and 2) decreasing energy intake by 420 kJ/day (100 kcal/day) from baseline levels. In our prior week AOM family study families were encouraged to increase steps by 2000 per day. Although participants did report signi cantly more steps/d than baseline throughout the study, neither children nor adults in the intervention reached the target 2000 steps/day increase. A recent meta-analysis has suggested studies using higher step goals (ie, 10,000 steps/day) were found to have a greater effect size on steps/day at the end of the intervention than studies using individualized goals. Therefore, in the current study, we chose to target a higher step goal (an increase of 4000 steps/day) in hopes that this would increase achievement of the actual desired step goal (an increase of 2000 steps/day).\nBoth groups received the same intervention content but differed only in the format in which the intervention was delivered (internet versus workbook). After a 1 week baseline period, families were studied for 12 weeks. Outcomes (sedentary behavior logs; objectively measured time spent in sedentary and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) were assessed during the baseline week and during weeks 6 and 12.

The participant's family must have been willing to follow the AOM family program, and the child must reside in the household more than 50% of the time. In addition, the participant's parent(s)/guardian(s) agreed not to make any changes to the participant's permitted level of physical/sedentary activity unrelated to the AOM intervention during the study (ie, they cannot change the amount of TV the participant is allowed to watch).\nChildren with physical or medical limitations that limited their ability to perform physical activity were excluded. All children in the family of the target age range were invited to participate.\nRecruitment methods included distributing yers through schools, recreational centers, doctors' of ces, and community events. After a scripted phone screening, eligible families attended an in-person screening during which the study's purpose and requirements were fully discussed and eligibility was con rmed. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents and the study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institution Review Board.

Subjects were shown a log by study staff and were asked to think about the previous day and, for each hour of the day, to identify all 15 minute intervals in which they a) watched TV, b) were sitting in front of the computer, or c) played video games. These logs were completed with participants twice (once when the accelerometer was initialized and once when it was returned) during each measurement period (baseline, week 6 and week 12). Total daily screen time was summed for each of the 24 hour periods.\nPhysical Activity and Inactivity. The Actical (Mini Mitter Co, Inc, Bend Oregon) omnidirectional accelerometer was used to provide an objective measure of physical activity and sedentary time over a 1-week period at baseline, weeks 6 and 12. Technical speci cations of the device have been described in detail elsewhere.\nParticipants were asked to wear the accelerometer continuously fora 1 week period. The Actical accelerometers are designed to be waterproof and were not removed for bathing or water activities. The device was attached to the participants' wrists using Soft Comfort WF MedTech Wristbands. The participant was notable to turnoff the unit; and data were collected continuously by the device. The participant was notable to see activity counts recorded by the unit. The data collection mode for the accelerometer was set to record activity counts every 15 seconds (15 sec epoch).\nData were analyzed during waking hours standardized as a 17-hour window between 6 AM and 11 PM. Data fora given day were considered valid if the accelerometer was worn for ≥ 10 hours (600 min), which is consistent with previously published recommendations for the use of an accelerometer to measure physical activity and with prior studies of children of this age range. Accelerometer nonwear was de ned as ≥ 60 continuous minutes of activity counts of 0 on the accelerometer, Subjects were required to have at least 4 valid days of accelerometry data including at least 1 weekend day to be included in the analysis, consistent with previously published recommendations for the use of an accelerometer to measure physical activity in children of this age range. Because only 1 other group has established intensity cut-points and validated the Actical for wrist placement in older children (8-14 years) we elected to conduct a calibration/validation experiment in our laboratory. Brie y, 22 children (12 girls, 10 boys) ages 6-11 (mean age 8.72 years, BMI range 14.1-25.0) were tted with the Oxycon Mobile portable metabolic cart (Care Fusion, Yorba Linda, CA) and an Actical accelerometer on the nondominant wrist. After a period of 20 minutes of quiet rest, each child performed a variety of tasks for 6 minutes each, including coloring, quiet standing, light aerobics, slow walking (0.75 m/s), fast walking (1.5 m/s), four-square, jogging (2.0 m/s), and jumping rope. We used the WHO/FAO/UNU equation for estimating resting energy expenditure to determine subject-speci c resting metabolic rate. We then divided measured VO 2 values for each activity by the predicted resting value to determine METs. Linear regression was used to determine appropriate accelerometry count cutpoints associated with sedentary (< 1.\n",

Chi-square tests and independent samples t tests were used to compare baseline characteristics between those randomized to internet versus workbook. Fisher's Exact Test was used to compare attrition rates. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze average screen time per day measured by the Sedentary Behavior Log, sedentary time measured by the Actical, and the amount of time spent performing moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) measured by the Actical. Linear mixed effects models allow for missing outcome data and account for the correlation within families and between the repeated measures on the same individual. Study time (baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks), study group (internet, workbook), and the time × study group interaction were included as categorical xed effects. A random family effect was included to account for multiple children per family. A Kronecker covariance structure (TYPE = UN@CS) was used for the repeated measures on an individual (3 time points × behavior logs at each time point for modeling screen time; 3 time points × 4 to 6 daily measurements at each time point for modeling MVPA and sedentary time). The covariance matrix was estimated separately for each study group to allow for heterogeneous covariance structures across the groups. ESTIMATE statements were used for making all within and between group comparisons.\nSubjects entered the study over a 6-month period from August through early January with follow-up assessments completed in October through March respectively. This time frame was chosen to correlate with the Denver Public School Calendar so that the majority of subjects were in school during the assessment period. However, seasonal variation has been shown to be a factor in children's activity levels with higher levels of activity in the summer versus winter. A second set of linear mixed effects models were t for each outcome adjusting for calendar month, sex, age, and BMI-for-age z-score to account for seasonal changes in screen time, sedentary time and MVPA during the winter months and to increase ef ciency by adjusting for other factors associated with the outcomes of interest.\nWe calculated a priori that with a sample size of 40 completers in each group, the precision of our estimate for the between-group difference in screen time, sedentary time and MVPA time would be ± 13.4 minutes (ie, the half-width of the 95% con dence intervals would be 13.4 minutes). This calculation assumed a standard deviation of 30 minutes per day for screen time and sedentary time and accelerometer measured MVPA in children. The observed standard deviation for MVPA time (±28 min per day) was very close to predicted, thus our study was powered to detect a difference of 15 min/day in MVPA time between groups. However, the observed standard deviations in weekly screen time (±109 min/day) and sedentary time (±65 min/day) were higher than anticipated and thus the half-widths of the 95% Con dence Intervals are much larger than expected.\n",

There were no signi cant differences between groups in sedentary time, screen time, or MVPA time at the end of the 12 week intervention, and no signi cant changes in these parameters over the course of the intervention in either group. Providing the AOM family intervention in an internet based format as compared with the traditional printed workbook format did not have a detrimental impact on either sedentary behavior or physical activity in overweight and normal weight children. Despite the fact that children's sedentary time might be expected to increase over the timeline that our study was performed (baseline measurements primarily in late summer/early fall and followup measurements in late fall/winter) we observed no signi cant increase in sedentary time in the internet based group. Using the internet to deliver a small changes based intervention over a 12-week period in normal weight and overweight children did not increase screen time (watching television, using a computer, or playing videogames) as assessed by self-reported behavior logs or sedentary time objectively assessed with an accelerometer. Importantly, we observed that attrition rates were lower in the group assigned to the internet based intervention suggesting that this mode of delivery maybe more engaging to children and families and could reduce attrition rates in a longer term study.\nAlthough demonstrating an increase in physical activity was not the primary purpose of the study, we observed no signi cant change in average MVPA in either the WB or IB group during the course of the study. This is in contrast to our previous AOM family studies in which a signi cant increase in PA (assessed by pedometers) was seen. However, we cannot conclude that the AOM intervention was ineffective without a concurrent control. It is possible that a control group would have demonstrated a signi cant reduction in PA during the course of the study compared with either the WB or IB groups. This is plausible given the current study was conducted between August 2010 and March 2011, with most participants enrolled by midfall and followed through midwinter. Children's activity levels have been shown to vary depending on season of measurement with lower levels of activity in the winter versus summer months. We similarly observed decreasing baseline MVPA levels among those enrolling through the fall and winter months, and month of measurement was a strong predictor of MVPA in the adjusted models (P < .0001). The AOM program could have been attenuating this expected drop in activity. The statistical models partially accounted for this by including calendar month as a covariate in the adjusted models, but we could not fully adjust for the seasonal effects given there were no baseline measurements in February and March and no follow-up measurements in August and September.\nThere were several other differences between our current and former studies that may have limited the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing MVPA. Both prior studies targeted families with overweight children, while our current study targeted both normal weight and overweight children. In the current study, the average BMI-for-age was around the 50th percentile and our study subjects were already very active at baseline (~73 min/day MVPA, exceeding current physical activity guidelines for children of > 60 min/day most days of the week). However, subgroup analyses did not nd a signicant intervention effect in either overweight children (n = 22) or in participants recording less than 60 minutes per day of MVPA at baseline (n = 42). The step goal targeted in this study (an increase of 4000 steps/day) was higher than the step goal targeted in our prior AOM studies (an increase of 2000 steps/day). If the higher step goal used in the current study was not felt by participants to be attainable or realistic it is possible that the goal setting approach used in this study to increase steps may have been marginalized or ignored. Future research with the AOM Family intervention should evaluate the optimal step goal and goal setting strategy. The current study employed an objective measure of PA, while both of our prior AOM family studies, change in PA was assessed with self-reported measures (collecting pedometer logs in which participants self-recorded steps/day). Finally, the AOM family intervention may require some \"in person\" contact (as was included in our prior studies) to enhance receipt of the intervention and have a signi cant impact on level of physical activity.\nChildren who were overweight (BMI forage > 85th percentile) were signi cantly less active at all study time points than normal weight children. In addition children who were overweight (BMI forage > 85th percentile) had higher levels of sedentary time at all study time points. The inverse association between PA levels and BMI percentile in children in this study is consistent with previous ndings. We also found no signi cant differences in response to the intervention (ie, change in sedentary behavior or MVPA time) in normal weight as compared with overweight children in the analyses adjusted for calendar month of measurement, age and gender.\nStrengths of our study include a randomized controlled design and use of objective measurements to assess sedentary time and physical activity. Limitations of our study include the fact that the variability in screen time and sedentary time was higher than anticipated in our sample size calculations. Given this, we cannot rule out difference between intervention groups of up to 21 min/day in sedentary time as assessed by the Actical (the upper limit for 95% con dence interval at week 12 was 20.86 minutes) and we cannot rule out a difference of up to 63 min/day in screen time as assessed by our sedentary behavior log (the upper limit for 95% con dence interval at week 12 was 63.13 minutes). In addition, our short term study was designed to evaluate the impact of an internet based intervention on sedentary behavior and was not designed or intended to evaluate the full impact of AOM message (ie, the longer term effect on parameters related to physical activity, energy intake and change in body weight). Actual time families spent receiving the intervention in either group, as well as data regarding workbook usage in the WB group (which could have been used to explore the extent to which the intervention was effectively delivered) was not collected as part of this study. Data from pedometer logs (which could have been used to explore whether children may have substituted steps for other activities) was also not collected. Finally, although subjects were required to reside in the primary study household > 50% of the time, we do not have data on how many participants were in split households.\n",

      "value": "Use of the internet to deliver a small changes based intervention over a 12-week period in children is a feasible strategy that does not appear to increase sedentary behavior or have a detrimental effect on physical activity in a group of normal weight and overweight children. An internet based intervention was also associated with lower attrition rates than the workbook based program over the 12-week intervention in this study. Based on the results of this short term study, we anticipate that providing the AOM Family intervention via an internet based format will improve subject retention and will not lead to increases in screen or sedentary time over a longer term period.\n",
