Healthy and ethnically-diverse adult females (N = 156) (mean age = 42.8 years, 65% Caucasian) from California were randomly assigned to an intervention (access to a tailored website and weekly emails) or waitlist control group. Participants completed web-based assessments of physical activity, stage of behavior change, and psychosocial variables at baseline, one month, two months, and three months. Data were collected during 2006-2007. Multilevel random coefficient modeling examined group differences in rates of change.\nResults. As compared to the control condition, the intervention group increased walking (+ 69 versus +32 min per week) and total moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (+23 versus −25 min per week) after three months. The intervention did not impact stage of behavior change or any of the other psychosocial variables.\nA tailored, Internet-based intervention for adult women had a positive effect on walking and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in an ethnically-diverse sample. However, given the lack of comparable research contact in the control group, these findings should betaken cautiously.",

      "value": "Participating in regular physical activity has been associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer. To achieve these health benefits, it is recommended that all adults engage in 30 minor more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most days of the week. Adult women are less likely to meet these physical activity recommendations than men. Recent estimates suggest that only 47.7% of adult women (versus 50.5% of men) report participation in 30+ min of moderate physical activity on five or more days per week or vigorous physical activity for 20+ min on three or more days per week. Given this gender gap, there is growing interest in developing interventions that effectively promote physical activity among adult women.\nDue to child and family obligations, women may face a number of challenges to participating in face-to-face physical activity programs (e.g., support groups, counseling), including alack of time, child-care needs, limited transportation and an inability to cover the financial costs. In recent years, there has been growing interest in Internet-based physical activity interventions, which could be especially helpful to women by allowing them to participate from their own home at a convenient time and fora low cost. Studies examining the efficacy of Internet-delivered programs have demonstrated small (e.g., to medium effect sizes for physical activity. However, little is known about webbased physical activity interventions specifically designed for women. There is some evidence to suggest that women maybe less interested in using interactive media than men. Women generally use the Internet less frequently, visit fewer web sites, and stay on the Internet for shorter periods of time. On the other hand, participation on Internet-delivered health websites emphasizing support and community has been found to be greater among women than men. Although women are less attracted to interactive media, they maybe more likely to consume and utilize Internetdelivered health information that takes a gender-based approach.\nResearch on the efficacy of Internet-delivered physical activity interventions among women is generally lacking. Of the thirteen studies identified by the review conducted by, only three Internet-based interventions specifically targeted adult women. An intervention providing brief weekly emails to women increased total walking minutes, but it did not include a control group). In the two other studies, the effects on physical activity were marginal and nonsignificant. All of these studies were also limited by the small proportion of racial/ethnic minority participants (b19%). To address these gaps, the present study served as an evaluation of the feasibility and efficacy of a gender-targeted and individually tailored Internet-plus-email physical activity intervention as compared to a non-technology wait-list control in a group of racially/ethnically-diverse women.\n",

In contrast, women in the control condition did not have access to the webpage until after the study was completed. They were not provided with any health-related information during the study period. Participants in both study arms completed web-based assessments of physical activity and psychosocial variables four times throughout the study (baseline, one-month, two-months, and three-months). Participants were sent a check for $25 after completing all of the surveys.\nPrior to randomization, women (1) participated in a telephone screening to assess eligibility, (2) provided informed consent to participate in the study and (3) completed the baseline set of online questionnaires. Random allocation to groups was conducted through a coin toss. An email from the researchers then informed participants of whether they had been assigned to the intervention or control group.

      "value": "The intervention webpage, called \"Women's Fitness Planner\" (WFP), was a component of a larger nutrition and physical activity website (www.MealsMatter.org). The WFP contained an interactive computer program that produced individualized physical activity feedback on the basis of information provided in an online assessment. The WFP was developed in 2000 by Dairy Council of California as away to offer tailored output direct to consumers at a low cost. The webpage targeted female users specifically by displaying pictures of age and activity specific photos of women exercising (e.g., pregnant women walking, young women stretching, middle-aged women jogging, and mature women gardening). Upon being directed to the WFP, an online assessment device measured physical activity level (including fre-quency, intensity and duration) and behavior change process variables such as barriers, motivators and stages of change. After this information was entered, the computer program generated a graph displaying each respondent's self-reported current level of activity compared to the 2005 USDA Dietary Guidelines for physical activity. The intervention utilized theoretical framework provided by the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Transtheoretical Model (TTM). Theory-based constructs were operationalized through the generation of tailored messages. Following the HBM, the intervention sought to reduce barriers to physical activity by providing suggestions for overcoming them. For example, participants who reported \"too busy to exercise\" as a barrier, received a tailored message that provided tips for overcoming this obstacle (e.g., \"Get your family to exercise with you. That way you're spending quality time together and being active at the same time!\"). The TTM was used to identify readiness to change and tailor output accordingly. For example, if participants reported they did not want to change their activity level (precontemplation or maintenance), a tailored message provided either the consequences of inactivity or reinforcement for meeting activity levels based on selfreported number of minutes of physical activity.\nIntervention participants also received 10 weekly follow-up email newsletters to support the messages and information provided on the website and to encourage further learning. The weekly email newsletter addressed topics such as how to measure activity intensity, how to keep an activity journal, goal setting, strength training, a review of the number of minutes recommended for activity and a link to downloadable log. Tips for weight management such as reminders to eat breakfast, information about appropriate portion sizes, and osteoporosis prevention were also included.\n",

If respondents participated in activities that were not on the list, they could add that activity through a write-in option. Physical activity estimates generated from this type of inventory format have been shown to correspond moderately with the Stanford 7-day recall instrument and other objective measures (e.g., maximum load, vital capacity, and body mass index). Researchers converted each activity into Metabolic Equivalents (METs) using the compendium developed by. Minutes-per-week in activities greater than or equal to 3.5 METS were summed in order to develop an indicator of moderate-tovigorous physical activity (MVPA).

This statistical technique determined group differences (i.e., intervention versus control) in the rates of change in the outcome variables. The level-1 model estimated separate slope coefficients for each participant, which were subsequently entered as dependent variables in the level-2 model predicted by group assignment. Multilevel random coefficient modeling is especially well suited for the analysis of repeated measures data clustered within the individual that violate standard statistical assumptions of non-independence. It also can handle missing data. The extent to which the intervention influenced the likelihood of being in the action or maintenance stage of behavior change was tested using the Hierarchical Generalized Linear Model (HGLM) function, a non-linear analysis for binary outcomes using the Bernoulli distribution. Robust standard errors were utilized for all analyses due to the positive skew observed for physical activity data. An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted for all outcomes.\n",

Third, some of the observed differences between groups were small in size (e.g., change in the proportion inaction and maintenance), possibly due to the moderate to low levels of intervention compliance (e.g., website usage and email opening) and/or initial desire for behavior change among members of the control group (i.e., overall study selection bias). Fourth, using a selfreport instrument to assess physical activity, the main outcome measure, could introduce recall and reporting biases. Lastly, findings may lack generalizability.
