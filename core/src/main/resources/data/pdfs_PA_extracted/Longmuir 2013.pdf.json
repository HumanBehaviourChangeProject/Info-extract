After Fontan, children are less active than recommended for optimal health. They are often geographically dispersed and unable to attend weekday programs. Participants, 5.9-11.7 years of age who were status 5.3 years post-Fontan, received 12-month, parent-delivered home programs to enhance physical activity, motor skill, fitness, and activity attitudes. Daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was measured at baseline and again at 6, 12, and months. Secondary outcomes were gross motor skill, fitness, and activity attitudes. Gross motor skill (p = .01) was significantly greater at the end of the 2-year study period for both intervention groups combined. MVPA at 2 years was significantly greater (p = .03) than the predicted decrease with age. Spring season (85 ± 25 min), male sex (69 ± 21 min), greater baseline activity (0.3 ± 0.1 min/baseline minute), and better gross motor skill (1.1 ± 0.4 min/percentile) increased weekly MVPA in a multivariable repeatedmeasures regression model adjusted for intervention, maturation during the 2-year study, sex, season, and baseline activity. Benefits were not influenced by type of rehabilitation, compliance, or rural/urban location. Home-based, pediatric physical activity rehabilitation enhances physical activity, gross motor skill, exercise capacity, and physical fitness among preadolescent children after Fontan regardless of rural/ urban location. Prescribed education and exercise programs are similarly effective for providing the important health benefits of daily physical activity. Enhanced gross motor skill is associated with increased MVPA despite exercise capacity limitations after Fontan. Rehabilitation attenuates the expected decrease in MVPA with age.",

      "value": "Cardiac rehabilitation includes exercise training, behavioral modification, psychosocial counseling, and risk-factor management. It is the standard of care for adult cardiac patients, although rural availability is limited. Cardiac rehabilitation for children with congenital heart defects is not well developed, although exercise training increases fitness during both the short and long terms.\nChildren with heart defects have sedentary lifestyles, a high prevalence of overweight beyond early childhood, and psychosocial challenges, suggesting that they would benefit from rehabilitation focused on physical activity behavior modification, healthy-lifestyle information, and psychosocial support. Complex heart defects are rare, which means that children are geographically dispersed. Unlike adult cardiac rehabilitation patients who are often retired or on leave from work, children's rehabilitation participation is dependent on parental availability and support. Effective rehabilitation for children with complex heart defects, in rural or urban locations, could be a template for all pediatric cardiac clinic patients.\nThis prospective, randomized comparison evaluated two rehabilitation models in preadolescent children with a functionally univentricular heart after Fontan. Both models focused on increasing physically active play, which has a significant role in childhood quality of life. We compared prescribed activity and education interventions using a parent-delivered format suitable for rural and urban locations. Both interventions prescribed specific daily activities to be performed. The activity intervention provided fitness and motor skill-development activities. The education program used play-based activities to build intrinsic motivation and develop the self-regulation skills needed to maintain greater physical activity levels after intervention. Educational activities were matched to the child/family's readiness fora change in the child's physical activity. We hypothesized that the education program would result in greater motivation and compliance during rehabilitation, which would be reflected in a slower decrease in postintervention physical activity. We also hypothesized that during the intervention, both programs would provide equal benefits for increasing daily physical activity, motor skill, and positive activity attitudes and perceptions.\n",

A CSAPPA score C57 points is associated with sufficiently positive attitudes fora physically active lifestyle. Approximately 50 % of our participants had attitude scores lower than the recommended value, and there was no significant change during the study. Rhodes et al. found that exercise training increased children's belief that their activity participation had increased, but they did not report on participants' attitudes toward physical activity. Attitudes that are long-standing and important to the individual are difficult to change. Potentially, the study length was insufficient for significant attitude change. Gross motor skill improvements should, theoretically, translate into greater self-perceived adequacy for physical activity. Greater predilection scores would be expected among children who believe their participation will be successful. Greater MVPA levels relative to predicted values at 24 months suggest that predilection scores may continue to develop overtime. Regardless, changes in attitude appear unnecessary to increase physical activity in this population.

Try not to make a big arm swing when you throw. Remember, it's the wrist flick that makes the disc spin, and it's the spin that makes the disc go farther -Judge where the ball will hit the ground closest to you, and move to that spot -Stand with your legs bent and your weight evenly distributed on both feet -As the ball hits the ground, bend both knees over the ball so that it hits both of your shins as is starts to bounce up off the ground -Straighten your legs as the ball hits to slow the ball's momentum Remember, judging where and how the ball will bounce takes time to learn. Be patient. A good trap means you gained control of the ball. It doesn't have to look pretty. One of the best ways to practice trapping the ball is by kicking it against a wall Practice kicking a soccer ball using the laces of your soccer boot (your cleats or running shoes). If you have a partner, practice kicking the ball to your partner. Otherwise, you can practice kicking the ball at a target on a wall so that the ball bounces back to you. When you kick the ball, try to kick the ball only with the top of your shoe. Try to hit the ball with the top of your shoe instead of the end of your shoe because kicking with the end can hurt your toes. The best kick uses the part of your shoe at the bottom of your laces. If you kick with the top of the laces (where they are tied in a bow), the knot can make the ball go the wrong direction, so always try to use the area of the laces that is closest to your toes (without the bow). See how many accurate kicks you can make so that your partner (or you) doesn't must move to get the ball. The first day, try to always kick the ball with your right foot. The second day, try to do all of the kicks with your left foot. See if you can play a game of disc golf this week. Disc golf is played like ball golf, except it uses a flying disc. One point is counted each time the disc is thrown and when a penalty is incurred. The object is to acquire the lowest score (without cheating). You must be standing behind the tee line or behind where your last throw landed before throwing again. The person farthest from the hole throws first. On a professional disc golf course, the ''hole'' is a metal basket on a pole. The basket is usually one metre or more above the ground, and there are chains hanging down about the basket (to cushion the disc and allow it to drop into the basket). If you don't have areal disc-golf course near your house, you can make your own by drawing circles on the ground or putting hoops or garbage cans around the course as holes\n",
