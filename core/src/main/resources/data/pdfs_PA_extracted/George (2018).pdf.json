Eighty-nine African American parents (41.5 ± 8.5 years; 92% females; 74% obese; 64% \\ $40 K income) and adolescents (12.5 ± 1.4 years; 61% girls; 48% obese) were randomized to a 6-week behavioral skills plus positive parenting and peer monitoring intervention grounded in social cognitive, self-determination, and family systems theories or a general health comparison program. Parents wore accelerometers for 7 days and completed three 24-h dietary recalls at baseline and post-intervention. Multilevel regression models (controlling for baseline variables) demonstrated a significantly greater increase in parent MVPA for those in the intervention versus comparison condition (b = 9.44, SE = 4.26, p \\ 0.05). There were no other significant effects. Family-based approaches that include African American parents and youth may increase parent MVPA and hold promise for preventing chronic diseases.",

      "value": "African Americans are at disproportionately greater risk for developing and/or dying from numerous preventable chronic diseases, including obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, than are non-Hispanic Whites (American Cancer Society, 2016; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017;. Engaging in regular physical activity (PA), reducing sedentary behavior, and consuming a healthy diet have been shown to attenuate risks associated with chronic diseases (e.g.,. However, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that only 48% of African American adults meet PA guidelines, and only 15 and 6% consume the recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables, respectively). Furthermore, it has been estimated that African American men and women spend over 80% of their waking time sedentary. Developing efficacious health promotion interventions for African American adults is thus an important national public health priority.\nInterventions that target healthy lifestyle behaviors, including PA, sedentary behavior, and diet, often involve the family system-namely, parents and their children. Despite the traditional focus on youth outcomes, involving parents in youth health promotion efforts maybe mutually beneficial for parents and children. Previous family-based healthy lifestyle interventions have shown improvements in the physical activity, sedentary behavior, and/or fruit and vegetable consumption of participating parents (e.g.,. In one intervention study, an increase in parent fruit and vegetable consumption significantly predicted an increase in child fruit and vegetable intake. Consistent with Social Cognitive Theory, these effects maybe explained by improved self-regulation for both parents and youth as well as increased parental modeling and social support, which have been associated with healthy lifestyle behaviors. For example, in a sample that included nearly 2500 girls (50% African American) followed for 10 years, Madsen and colleagues found that girls who perceived their parents to be physically active were 50% more active than those who perceived their parents to be sedentary. Overall, given the majority of U.S. adults are failing to meet national recommendations for healthy lifestyle behaviors, family-based approaches may facilitate parents in making their own lifestyle changes to model for and support their children's health behavior change efforts.\nPrevious family-based health promotion interventions developed specifically for African American families have been delivered using either separate or joint sessions for parents and children, have included culturally-relevant content (e.g., music, dance, food/recipes), and have targeted behavioral skill-building (e.g., goal-setting, self-monitoring, positive reinforcement) and changes to the home environment (e.g., increasing the availability of healthy foods, decreasing screen time) (e.g.,. As noted in a review of family-focused interventions targeting physical activity, diet, and obesity interventions in African American girls and their parents, while these interventions generally show promise for youth outcomes, particularly when participating family members are encouraged to change their own health behaviors (Barr-Anderson, Adams-Wynn, DiSantis, & Kumanyika, 2013), very little is known regarding caregiver outcomes. Of the 27 studies reviewed by, only 37% targeted a change in the participating family members' own behaviors, and these effects do not seem to be consistently reported in the literature. It is therefore important to target, assess, and report these effects so as to more fully appreciate the intervention's impact on the family system.\nProject SHINE (Supporting Health Interactively through Nutrition and Exercise) is a 6-week family-based behav-ioral skills plus positive parenting and peer monitoring intervention for African American adolescents and their caregivers that targeted improvements in PA, sedentary behavior, and diet. The intervention significantly reduced adolescent self-reported sedentary behavior for those randomized to the intervention condition compared to those in a general health education comparison condition. There was also a significant interaction effect between the intervention condition and parent-adolescent communication predicting adolescent self-reported sedentary behavior. Specifically, parents in the intervention condition who reported more positive communication around health behaviors had adolescents who reported lower sedentary behavior at post-intervention than did those with less positive communication or those in the comparison condition. No other intervention effects were observed for youth participating in the study. This paper extends previous work by evaluating the effects of Project SHINE on parent healthy lifestyle behaviors, specifically moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), light PA (LPA), sedentary behavior, and fruit and vegetable intake. It was hypothesized that parents into the intervention condition would increase their MVPA, LPA, and fruit and vegetable intake and reduce their sedentary behavior from baseline to post-intervention relative to those in a general health education comparison condition.\n",

Families were stratified by adolescent sex and weight status and randomly assigned to one of two evenings (Tuesdays or Thursdays) by the first author using a digital coin flip (www.random.org). Evenings were then randomized to a condition by a staff member blind to each family's assigned evening using a digital coin flip. This process ensured allocation concealment. All families participated in a 2-week ''run-in'' period prior to being randomized to a condition, a strategy previously shown to maximize retention. Attendance at the two run-in sessions was required (though make-up sessions were permitted) for continued participation throughout the remaining 6 weeks. During the run-in, facilitators provided an overview of the program, and a local African American dietitian provided education on national recommendations for healthy lifestyle behaviors (e.g., 60 min/day of PA for youth). All group sessions for both the intervention and comparison conditions were held at a university setting and led by two facilitators who were graduate students in clinical psychology or public health (n = 6, 83% female, 50% African American, 33% Caucasian, 17% Hispanic). To reduce facilitator effects, the two facilitators who led intervention group sessions also led the concurrently occurring comparison group sessions across all five cohorts. Prior to leading sessions, facilitators completed 10 h of face-to-face training that included didactics, group discussions, role-plays, and activities related to the theoretical model. Lead facilitators for each group were doctoral students in clinical psychology and received required cultural competency training as part of their degree program. Trained staff (blind to randomization) collected all measures at baseline (Week 0) and immediately following the 6-week intervention period (Week 8).

      "value": "A detailed intervention description, including a curriculum matrix, essential elements, and process evaluation data, has been previously published. The theoretical framework used to develop the intervention integrated behavioral strategies from Social Cognitive Theory (e.g., self-monitoring, goalsetting), elements involved in facilitating intrinsic motivation from Self-Determination Theory (i.e., autonomy, competence, belongingness), and positive parenting practices from Family Systems Theory (e.g., parent-adolescent communication, parental monitoring of peers). The intervention conceptual framework is depicted in Fig.. Overall, the intervention targeted behavioral, motivational, and par-enting variables through interactive sessions designed to teach parents and adolescents how to change their healthy lifestyle behaviors and parents how to refine their positive parenting practices (e.g., communication skills, social support, autonomy support, parental monitoring and management of peer relationships) to support adolescent health behavior change. Cultural targeting strategies were used to enhance the intervention's relevance for African American families. Specifically, the intervention used peripheral strategies (e.g., featuring photos of African American families in study materials), evidential strategies (e.g., providing national data related to African American youth), and constituent-involving strategies (e.g., having an African American dietician and community leader as outside speakers).\nParents and adolescents jointly attended six 1.5-h weekly face-to-face group sessions. Each week, facilitators challenged parents and adolescents to work on a healthy lifestyle behavior of their choice (either PA, sedentary behavior, or diet-related) by self-monitoring, setting goals, and implementing new skills learned. Facilitators met individually with families for 5-15 min immediately before or after weekly group sessions to review progress towards their goals by discussing relevant barriers (e.g., ''What, if anything, got in the way of you meeting your goal this week?'') and reinforcing change through action planning (e.g., ''What do you think you can do differently this week to meet your goal?). These brief, individualized feedback sessions were part of the process of greeting families as they arrived to group sessions.\nDuring the first group session, facilitators reviewed positive communication skills (e.g., active listening, using ''I'' statements, taking turns making brief statements, using a neutral tone of voice, making eye contact), and families collaboratively set group ground rules (e.g., ''allow time for everyone to express their point,'' ''listen with an open mind'') to reinforce communication skills. Families were also encouraged to use positive communication skills to discuss how they were doing with regard to their healthy lifestyle behaviors during a ''Family Walk & Talk.'' During the second and third group sessions, parents and adolescents participated in separate discussions related to how family members and friends influenced healthy lifestyle behaviors. Families learned strategies for effective problem solving (e.g., define the problem, brainstorm all possible solutions, make a joint decision, discuss a plan for follow through) and were encouraged to negotiate two family rules related to their ongoing behavior change goals. Parents were also provided with specific behaviorally-based parenting strategies (e.g., descriptive praise, shared decision-making) associated with supporting their adolescent in meeting behavior change goals. The fourth group session emphasized the importance of peer relationships during adolescence and the role parents play in managing peer relationships around healthy lifestyle behaviors. Adolescents were encouraged to bring a friend to this session, and friends were integrated into activities. During the fifth group session, families examined their progress and readjusted their goals as needed. A local African American community leader and author specializing in youth development shared his personal health testimonial and discussed parenting concepts (e.g., parental monitoring) from his book on parenting. The sixth and final group session focused on maintaining health behavior changes through relapse prevention strategies. ''Family Bonding Activities'' (e.g., engage in a healthy activity together with your family and a friend) were assigned as weekly take-home activities to reinforce skill building.\nParticipants in the intervention condition attended an average of 4.39 ± 1.51 sessions (not including make-up sessions) and 4.92 ± 1.48 sessions (including make-up sessions). Ratings of facilitator adherence (i.e., how well intervention was delivered in accordance with the theoretical framework) and competence (i.e., clinical skill) made by a trained, independent evaluator, indicated that the intervention was delivered with high fidelity and have been described in detail elsewhere.\n",

Average scores of height and weight were used in anthropometric calculations of body mass index (BMI).\nSeven-day accelerometry estimates (MVPA, LPA, sedentary behavior)\nSeven-day accelerometry estimates for MVPA, LPA, and sedentary behavior were assessed with the Actical omnidirectional accelerometers worn on the right hip. Actical has been previously validated as a measure of adult PA. Data were recorded in 1-min epochs, and consistent with previous PA trials with large samples of African American adults, 60 min of consecutive zeros were used to define non-wear. Raw activity data were converted into time spent in MVPA, LPA, and sedentary behavior based on Actical-specific count thresholds for adults (sedentary behavior \\ 100, LPA = 100 to \\ 1075, and MVPA C 1075).\nMultiple imputation methods (see statistical analysis) were applied to missing data. Days were divided into time intervals (6-9 am, 9 am-2 pm, 2-5 pm, 5-8 pm, 8 pm-12 am) to enhance the precision of the imputation procedures by providing additional information for the imputation model (i.e., correlations in PA between time blocks across days) that would otherwise be absent. This has been done in previous PA trials using multiple imputation procedures with accelerometry data. Despite the use of these time intervals for the imputation procedures, the outcomes remained average overall daily minutes of PA across different intensities. Valid wear was defined as time intervals during which the accelerometer was worn for at least 80% of the time interval. Otherwise stated, a time block fora given participant was considered missing if 20% of that time block was non-wear. After imputation, minutes per day of MVPA, LPA, and sedentary behavior were calculated by summing time points for each day and averaging the 7 days.\n",

Analyses with multiply imputed data involve a three-step process wherein multiple data sets are first generated, analyst models are estimated separately for each of the data sets, and pooled estimates of parameters and standard errors across analyst models are computed. Because this study contains a nested data structure (individuals within groups), an imputation function that modelled multilevel data was used (van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). Specifically, the ''mice.impute.2l.norm'' function of the package ''mice'' in the statistical program R (Version 2.15.1) allowed for specification of the class variable (i.e., group) as well as inclusion of a random effect in each of the imputation models. Importantly, participants' data are weighted according to the amount of valid information in the imputation model; as such, information from those who provide less data is down-weighted. Plots of imputed values indicated adequate convergence, and fractions of missing information are reported.\nAccelerometry data were imputed in two phases at each time point to enhance the precision of the estimates. In the first phase, data were imputed at the interval level. Participants who had complete missing data were thus removed from this phase. In the second phase, those who had complete missing data were added back into the dataset and their data were imputed at the summary level instead of the interval level. This process resulted in 20 datasets (1 per imputation) with complete data for all 89 participants for our analyses. Accelerometry data from parents and 70 parents were included in the phase 1 imputations at baseline and post-intervention, respectively. For those whose data was included in the phase 1 imputations, the percentage of interval-level accelerometry data missing due to non-compliance was 13% for parents at baseline and 20% for parents at post-intervention. These rates of missing data due to non-compliance in studies that have used multiple imputation procedures are similar to those found in previous PA trials conducted with African American samples.\nIn terms of dietary recalls, 62% of parents completed at least three recalls at baseline, and 57% from the full sample did so at post-intervention. There were no significant differences in outcomes of interest at baseline for those missing data at post-intervention.\n",

The intervention resulted in improvements in parent MVPA at post-intervention after controlling for baseline MVPA, such that those in the intervention condition reported approximately nine more minutes per day of MVPA at post-intervention than did those in the comparison condition. No other effects were significant. This study provides preliminary support of a family-based intervention for improving parent accelerometer-assessed MVPA in African American families.\nFindings from this study highlight the potentially beneficial effects of family-based health promotion interven-  tions on African American adults and the importance of assessing changes in both youth and adult health behaviors. For adults in the intervention, 76% of whom were in the obese weight range, MVPA increased by nearly a 10-min bout per day relative to those in the comparison condition.\nA pooled analysis of data from [ 650,000 adults in the National Cancer Institute Cohort Consortium showed that compared to no physical activity, a physical activity level equivalent to brisk walking for approximately 10 min/day was associated with 1.8 additional years of life expectancy. In the present study, the mean minutes per week of MVPA for parents in the intervention condition at post-intervention (27.3 min/day 9 7 days/week = 191.1 min/week) was also consistent with meeting the recommended 150 weekly minutes of moderate intensity PA for adults as outlined by the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (Physical Activity Guidelines Committee, 2008).\nIn light of parent increases in MVPA, findings from this study have important implications for chronic disease  prevention in African American adults, particularly in African American women who are 2.10 times more likely than non-Hispanic white women to be obese. Increasing PA has been strongly associated with preventing chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. For example, in a large sample of adults from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort study that included over 3000 African Americans, PA had a strong inverse association with cardiovascular disease, heart failure, coronary heart disease, and stroke incidence in African Americans. Although data indicated that some PA was better than none, hazard ratios for incident cardiovascular disease were lower as levels of PA increased (i.e., 0.59 for recommended levels of PA, 0.65 for intermediate physical activity, 1.00 for poor physical activity). Authors noted that these associations were present regardless of participant obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipi-demia. Similarly, for participants followed for 10 years as part of the Black Women's Health Study (n = 45,668), both vigorous activity and brisk walking were inversely associated with type 2 diabetes risk.\nThe intervention had no effect on other parent outcomes. Because this was a small study, power to detect significant intervention effects was limited at the outset. Post-hoc power analyses using standard errors found in models with non-significant effects indicated the intervention had 80% power to detect only large effects, which are typically not observed in behavioral interventions. Furthermore, low reliability of dietary recall measures may have further contributed to low power.\nLimitations of the current study include the short intervention duration, lack of followup, small sample size, and use of convenience sampling. Generalizability of findings may thus be limited. Follow-up data may have been especially beneficial for monitoring effects overtime. These limitations aside, research examining family-based health promotion interventions in ethnic minorities is limited, and even fewer randomized controlled trials have assessed outcomes in youth and parents alike. This study shows promise for improving accelerometry-assessed PA in African American adults through a family-based approach and potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes. The intervention is novel in that it used a combination of behavioral and positive parenting skills for health behavior change. Another notable strength of this study is the use of rigorous methods (i.e., randomization, multiple imputation, multilevel models, 7-day accelerometry estimates). The intervention has already been adapted in a large-scale randomized trial known as Families Improving Together (FIT) for weight loss that is testing a positive parenting intervention on reducing zBMI in African American adolescents and their parents. Findings from that trial are forthcoming. Overall, longitudinal trials are needed to replicate the PA-related findings from the present study and to better determine which program components are most effective in promoting MVPA in ethnic minority parents.\n",
