      "value": "Background: Unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity increase rural midlife and older women's risk of chronic diseases and premature death, and they are behind urban residents in meeting Healthy People 2010 objectives. b Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare a tailored intervention based on the Health Promotion Model with a generic intervention to increase physical activity and healthy eating among rural women. b Methods: Ina randomized-by-site, community-based, controlled, clinical trial, Wellness for Women, 225 women aged 50 to 69 years were recruited in two similar rural areas. Over 12 months, women received by mail either 18 generic newsletters or 18 newsletters computer tailored on Health Promotion Model behavior-specific cognitions (benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, and interpersonal support), activity, and eating. Outcomes at 6 and 12 months included behavioral markers and biomarkers of physical activity and eating. Data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance and chi-square tests (! G .05). b Results: Both groups significantly increased stretching and strengthening exercise and fruit and vegetable servings and decreased percentage of calories from fat, whereas only the tailored group increased moderate or greater intensity activity and decreased percentage of calories from saturated fat from baseline to 6 months. Both groups increased stretching and strengthening exercise, whereas only the tailored group increased moderate or greater intensity activity and fruit and vegetable servings and decreased percentage of calories from fat from baseline to 12 months. Both groups had several changes in biomarkers over the study. A higher proportion of women receiving tailored newsletters met Healthy People 2010 criteria for moderate or greater intensity activity, fruit and vegetable servings, and percentage of calories from fat at 12 months. b Discussion: Mailed computer-tailored and generic print newsletters facilitated the adoption of change in both activity and eating over 6 months. Tailored newsletters were more efficacious in facilitating changeover 12 months. b Key Words: exercise and eating & Health Promotion Model & middle-aged and aged women & randomized controlled trial & rural population\nL ifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and physical activity, play a much greater role than does genetics in determining how well one ages (Ory, Kinney Hoffman, Hawkins, Sanner, & Mockenhaupt, 2003). Unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity increase the risk of many chronic diseases and account for more than 300,000 premature deaths annually in the United States (Mokdad, Marks, Stroup, & Gerberding, 2005).\nMidlife and older rural women are high-priority targets for lifestyle behavior change. Women have a greater incidence of chronic illness, functional limitations, and disability than that of men as they age (Murtagh & Hubert, 2004). Rural populations have a greater incidence of chronic disease (National Center for Health Statistics, 2002)  and less access to healthcare services (Gamm, Hutchinson, Linnae, Dabney, & Dorsey, 2003). They are less likely to obtain preventive health services and are behind urban residents in meeting Healthy People (HP) 2010 objectives (Casey, Thiede Call, & Klingner, 2001). Midlife and older rural women have higher rates of sedentary behavior (Wilcox, Castro, King, Housemann, & Brownson, 2000) and consumption of high-fat diets (Gamm et al., 2003) than those of urban women. The HP 2010 objectives (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000) reflect consensus that midlife and older women should reduce consumption of dietary fat; increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, and grain products; and engage regularly in moderate-intensity physical activity and activity to enhance muscular strength, endurance, and flexibility. Little or no progress toward these objectives has been achieved in the first half of this decade (HP 2010(HP  , 2006.",

      "value": "The National Institutes of Health drew attention to the need for research on multiple-behavior change interventions in 1999. Interventions based on a single theoretical framework that addressed two or more health behaviors were expected to have greater impact on public health than that of attempts to change a single behavior. No intervention trials targeting comprehensive change in both physical activity and healthy eating for rural midlife and older women have been reported. Development and evaluation of distance delivery approaches to lifestyle behavior change for underserved and often isolated rural women are needed.\nMailed computer-tailored newsletters provide one such approach. Tailoring is an approach to facilitating lifestyle behavior change that has been used extensively in faceto-face interactions when health professionals interview clients and develop an individualized plan. Computers have allowed for personalized feedback and advice to population groups by generating messages based on participant responses to questionnaires.\nThe purpose of this clinical trial was to compare the efficacy of a tailored intervention framed within the Health Promotion Model (HPM; with that of a generic (nontailored) intervention in facilitating change in physical activity and healthy eating among rural women aged 50 to 69 years. Primary outcomes were change from baseline to 6 and 12 months in (a) eating behavioral markers (fruit and vegetable servings, wholegrain servings, and percentage of calories from fat and saturated fat), (b) activity behavioral markers (minutes of moderate or greater intensity activity, kilocalories expended, and minutes of stretching and strength exercise) and biomarkers (estimated VO 2max , flexibility, and lower body strength), and (c) biomarkers influenced by eating and activity (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, percentage of body fat, body mass index, and serum lipids). Secondary outcomes were achievement at 6 and 12 months of HP 2010 behavioral criterion standards: (a) engaging regularly in moderate or greater intensity physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day and (b) meeting daily goals of at least two servings of fruits, three servings of vegetables, and three servings of whole grains; no more than 30% of calories from fat; and less than 10% of calories from saturated fat.\n",

Eleven of the studies (19%) based messages on social cognitive theory. In 40 studies that compared tailored with nontailored messages, results favored the tailored message, although the sample-size-weighted mean effect size was slightly less than small. systematically reviewed 30 randomized controlled trials of computer-tailored interventions to change physical activity, nutrition, or both behaviors published from 1965 to 2004. In 3 of the 11 studies of physical activity and 20 of the 26 studies of nutrition behavior, significant effects of the tailored interventions were found when compared with those of generic interventions or of no intervention. The authors emphasized that, ''although this review indicates that effects of tailored interventions are mostly small, when such small effects can be reached in the population at large, public health effects maybe substantial.'.\nOnly five randomized controlled trials that compared print tailored with generic messages (the best test of tailoring) to address change in both eating and activity behaviors were found. None were targeted specifically to older female rural populations. Interventions included tailoring on eating and activity behaviors and on one or more behavioral influences, consistent with the conceptual framework used. In three of the five studies, only a single tailored communication was delivered to participants. Behavior change outcomes, almost exclusively behavioral markers, were assessed over periods of 1 to 12 months. In only one study were biomarkers measured in a 25% subsample that was underpowered to detect significant group differences. Tailored print messages were more effective than were generic print messages in fostering change in both behaviors in three studies and in eating alone in two studies.\n",

The HPM was selected because midlife and older women maybe more interested in enhancing health to maintain independence than in avoiding specific diseases as they age. The theoretical underpinnings of the HPM are provided by social cognitive theory. Four behavior-specific cognitions (perceived benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, and interpersonal influences) were selected from the HPM for use in designing the tailored intervention. These cognitions, considered modifiable through intervention, are those for which there is empirical evidence supporting predictive validity as behavioral determinants. lasted for 12 months, and follow-up extended an additional 12 months.

Power was estimated to be less than .80 for chi-square analyses for the secondary outcomes, but they were conducted for their descriptive value.\nUniversity survey center personnel used random-digit dialing to recruit 225 participants from two rural areas in a Midwestern state with similar demographic profiles. Women were screened for inclusion criteria: age of 50Y69 years, able to speak English, able to use a computer with assistance to complete a survey, access to a video recorder to view physical activity demonstration tapes, able to answer ''no'' to all questions on the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q; American College of Sports Medicine or to obtain physician clearance, and not undergoing cardiac or physical rehabilitation. To ensure that all participants would have the potential for change in both activity and eating, exclusion criteria were being in the maintenance stage for all three components of readiness for change in physical activity (aerobic, stretching, and muscle strengthening exercise) or all three components of readiness for change in healthy eating (consumption of fruits and vegetables, grain products, and fat); restrictions that would preclude them from following the HP 2010 recommendations for both moderate physical activity and healthy eating; unable to walk without an assistive device (including canes, crutches, walkers, and oxygen); and unable to walk 1 mile continuously without resting.

Achievement of HP 2010 behavioral criterion standards was calculated from these data. Time engaged weekly in strengthening and stretching exercises was measured using two items in a format similar to that of the Modified 7-Day Activity Recall. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured using the 1-mile walk test, which provides an estimate of VO 2max from the variables of weight, age, gender, track walk time (minutes), and 15-second final heart rate; participants were asked to walk as fast as they comfortably could for 1 mile on an indoor walk route that was the same for all women at that site. Flexibility was measured by the modified sit-and-reach test, which was recommended by the ACSM () as a measurement of general flexibility. Lower body muscular strength was measured by repeated timed chair stands, which required participants to complete 10 full stands from a sitting position as quickly as possible while being timed to the nearest second.\nHealthy Eating Self-reported daily servings of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain products and daily intake of dietary fat (percentage of calories from total fat and saturated fat) were measured by the Web-based version of the 1998 Block Health Habits and History Questionnaire that measures the usual self-selected diets of individuals over a period of time. The time frame used for this study was the past year at baseline and since the last assessment at subsequent points. Achievement of HP 2010 behavioral criterion standards was calculated from these data.\nBiomarkers Affected by Activity and Eating Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured before physical activity testing, using a calibrated mercury sphygmomanometer and following standardized auscultatory methods. Percentage of body fat was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis following the manufacturer's instructions (Biodynamics Model 310e Body Composition Analyzer, Biodynamics Corporation, Seattle, WA; National Institutes of Health Consensus Statement, 1996). Serum lipids were measured by biochemical analyses of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides after a 12-hour fast.\n",

      "value": "The major intervention components were tailored or generic newsletters that were mailed to the women; these were supplemented by plans of action in the tailored group and by physical activity instructional videotapes and feedback on assessment results provided to all participants.\nNewsletters (Tailored vs. Generic) Both groups received 18 newsletters. During the first 6 months, newsletters were sent every 2 weeks. During the second 6 months, newsletters were sent every 4 weeks. The overall theme for each newsletter sent to women in both groups was the same, and content was targeted to midlife and older women. Both sets of newsletters were formatted with similar layout, typeface, and length to control for differences in appearance.\nEach of the 18 newsletters for both groups included advice about desired behavioral changes in physical activity and healthy eating; selected newsletters also included information about HPM determinants (the benefits of healthy eating and activity, overcoming barriers to behavior change, building confidence in the ability to follow eating and activity guidelines, and obtaining support from family and peers). Tailored newsletters included only content relevant to the individual recipient, as indicated by assessment responses, whereas generic newsletters included a wider range of general content on the same topics. A library of hundreds of text messages for tailoring was created to correspond to individual women's assessment data, including activity and eating goals, self-reports, and biomarkers, and perceived most important benefits, greatest barriers, self-efficacy, and support from family and peers. Each possible response on measures of the HPM behavioral determinants was matched by the computer with a unique message from the text message library to be delivered to women who selected that response.\nThe data management system for generation of the tailored newsletters was developed and implemented by the project's information technologist. Data were collected from study participants using an online assessment instrument developed with Macromedia ColdFusion (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA) maintaining a dynamic interface with a Microsoft Access database (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) residing on a secure server at the university medical center. Tailored newsletters were generated from this database using a ColdFusion interface, which placed them in an Acrobat (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA) window where they were printed.\nCommitment to a Plan of Action Although the generic group received newsletter messages to set goals for behavior change, only the tailored group committed to a plan to accomplish self-identified behavior-specific goals in each 3-month period. A computerized plan-of-action form listed possible goals for change in physical activity and healthy eating behaviors from which participants could choose. Each woman in the tailored group was asked to choose and designate frequency for one or two physical activities and to choose one healthy eating behavior in each of the three categories of fruits and vegetables, fat intake, and grain intake. At each assessment period, women in the tailored group affirmed their commitment to behavior change by selecting goals on the computer.\nVideotapes A videotape and companion manual, ''Exercise: A Video from the National Institute on Aging,'' was distributed to both groups at baseline. The videotape demonstrated moderate-intensity physical activities shown to increase cardiorespiratory fitness in older adults.\nA second videotape, ''Banding Together for Strength B ,'' was developed for the project and distributed to both groups at the 3-month assessment. It illustrated specific methods for safe stretching and muscle strengthening with Thera-Band A (The Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH) resistive bands. Each woman was given two lengths of banding with resistance based on her upper and lower body strength measurements at baseline so that she could do the muscle strengthening exercises shown on the videotape. Bands could be replaced every 3 months as her strength increased or between assessments when she was able to do 15 repetitions comfortably and requested that a higher resistance band be sent to her.\n",

Food pyramid magnets with recommended servings of foods from each food group were distributed as a reminder of the guidelines for healthy eating and were to be placed on their refrigerator.\n",

Analyses of change in behavioral markers and biomarkers of physical activity and healthy eating were based on intention to treat. Square-root and logarithmic transformations were used to normalize the positively skewed distributions of several variables by reducing the effects of a small number of outliers (Tables). Only three variables were missing more than 6% of observations at anyone time: chair stands and sit-andreach test, with 0%Y11% missing across the three times, and VO 2max , with 4%Y18% missing. Ninety-four percent of cases had complete data or were missing less than 5% of their observations. The remaining cases tended to be missing all data for one or more collection times. Maximum likelihood estimates of missing data values at the 6-and 12-month assessments for all variables except cardiorespiratory fitness (VO 2max ) were imputed via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm as implemented in SPSS Missing Values Analysis Version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Missing values on VO 2max were not imputed because they could not be considered missing at random as they were due to the inability of some participants to perform the task.\nFor each primary outcome, two analyses were done. A 2 (Group) Â 3 (Time) RM-ANOVA was performed to compare differences overtime in the tailored and generic newsletter groups. Main effects for Time and Time Â Newsletter Group are reported from these analyses. A second analysis utilized an approach common in the health behavior literature, planned comparisons of simple main effects of time within group. Comparisons of changes from baseline to 6 and 12 months in each group are reported for these analyses. For the secondary outcomes, a series of chisquare tests for 2 Â 2 contingency tables were used to compare the proportion of women in each group achieving the specified HP 2010 physical activity and healthy eating behavioral criterion standards at 6 and 12 months. Alpha of .05 was used for all analyses except the planned comparisons, for which a Bonferroni-adjusted value of .017 was used to adjust for the three possible pairwise comparisons.\nAnalyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package (SPSS Version 11.5.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc.).

Both groups improved significantly from baseline to 6 months on all measures. From baseline to 12 months, both groups improved on cardiorespiratory fitness, weekly stretching exercise, weekly strength exercise, flexibility, and lower body strength, whereas only the tailored newsletter group improved on minutes of daily moderate or greater intensity activity. Nevertheless, the Time Â Group interaction for daily minutes of moderate or greater intensity activity was not significant. This maybe due to the much larger standard deviation for the tailored group (SD = 749.4) as compared with that of the generic group (SD = 360.1) at 12 months. The Time Â Group interaction was significant only for timed chair stands, indicating that the groups differed significantly in change in lower body strength over the three time points. Post hoc comparisons revealed that the tailored group had achieved greater strength than did the generic group at both 6 (p = .008) and 12 months (p = .002).\nHealthy Eating All behavioral markers and biomarkers of healthy eating except for whole-grain servings had significant main effects for time over the intervention period. From baseline to 6 months, both groups significantly increased fruit and vegetable servings and decreased percentage of calories from fat, whereas only the tailored group decreased percentage of calories from saturated fat. From baseline to 12 months, only the tailored group showed significant changes, with an increase in fruit and vegetable servings and a decrease in percentage of calories from saturated fat. The Time Â Group interaction was significant for both fruit and vegetable servings and percentage of calories from saturated fat, indicating that the groups differed significantly in change in intake over the three time points. Post hoc comparisons revealed that the tailored group had sustained their increased intake of fruits and vegetables at 12 months, whereas the generic group had dropped back to baseline levels (p = .002). The tailored group consumed a lower percentage of calories from saturated fat than that consumed  by the generic group at both 6 (p = .028) and 12 months (p G .001).\nBiomarkers of Activity and Eating Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, and LDL cholesterol level had significant main effects for time over the intervention period. From baseline to 6 months, both groups had significantly lower LDL cholesterol level, whereas only the tailored group had lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and only the generic group had a decreased body mass index. From baseline to 12 months, only the tailored group had lower systolic blood pressure, whereas both groups had lower diastolic blood pressure and lower LDL cholesterol levels. The Time Â Group interaction was significant for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and for percent body fat, indicating that the groups differed significantly in change in these biomarkers over the three time points. Post hoc comparisons revealed that the pattern of change in blood pressure differed, with the generic group having higher values at 6 months and lower values at 12 months than those of the tailored group.

      "value": "The Wellness for Women trial provides the first reported results of a randomized computer-tailored intervention as compared with those of a generic intervention employing distance methodology to facilitate change in both physical activity and healthy eating in rural midlife and older women. Both the newsletters and exercise videotapes were designed for use with this population. Unlike the few other reported studies of randomized controlled tailored interventions to encourage change in both activity and eating, this study augmented self-reported behavioral markers with objective biomarkers of activity and eating to measure outcomes in all enrollees. Whereas most tailored print health behavior change interventions have provided only one or two tailored communications to participants, this study provided multiple communications (18 newsletters) over 12 months to allow time for incorporation of behavior change into lifestyle. Women were not required to leave their rural areas for either assessments or intervention. The intervention was entirely home based, with newsletters mailed directly to their homes. The convenience of this approach may have contributed to the exceptionally low 4.4% overall attrition rate. Differential dropout between study arms (7.8% in the tailored newsletter group and 1.8% in the generic newsletter group) is recognized but is not of great concern because the reasons for dropping out seem unrelated to the intervention.\nFor the primary outcomes, time effects were significant for most behavioral markers and biomarkers of activity and eating over the three study time points, with moderate to large rather than small effect sizes, as reported in other studies. The only eating behavior that did not change was whole-grain servings, which remained approximately one daily despite repeated encouragement in the newsletters to increase intake to three. This may have been influenced by public media attention to the value of low-carbohydrate diets during the intervention period. Women may not have discriminated between whole grains and carbohydrates in general when they heard such advice. Significant group differences over the three study time points, favoring the tailored group, were found for fruit and vegetable servings, percentage of calories from saturated fat, lower body muscular strength, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and percent body fat.\nNewsletter effects were most apparent when examining the simple main effects tests of each group's change in behavior separately at 6 and 12 months. From baseline to 6 months, both groups improved on all three activity and two eating behaviors, whereas only the tailored group improved on a third eating behavior. From baseline to 12 months, both groups improved on stretching and strength exercise, but only the tailored group improved on moderate or greater intensity physical activity. Women who received tailored newsletters increased their weekly minutes of activity by 74%, an impressive change. The generic group had no change in eating behavior, whereas the women in tailored group increased their average daily servings of fruits and vegetables from 5.7 at baseline to 6.6 at 12 months and decreased their percentage of calories from saturated fat from 11.3% to 10.5% daily but were still above the recommended 10% or less. It was apparent that tailored newsletters, based on women's individual assessment data, had a stronger effect on behavior over a longer time and may lead to more permanent lifestyle change.\nFairly similar changes in biomarkers were evident from baseline to 6 and 12 months, with the tailored newsletter group improving on one and two more biomarkers, respectively, than the generic newsletter group. Some clinically important changes in biomarkers were noted. Both groups improved their cardiorespiratory fitness (VO 2max ) from baseline to 12 months, the tailored group by 7.4% and the generic group by 5.8%. This exceeded the 5% increase in VO 2max achieved in several randomized clinical trials of physical activity counseling with sedentary adults aged 30Y75 years (Writing Group for the Activity Counseling Trial Research Group, 2001) and was impressive considering that the women's baseline fitness levels (X = 20.22 ml/kg/min) were well below the average of 24.5 ml/kg/min for their age and gender. From baseline to 12 months, women lowered their LDL cholesterol levels to near-optimal levels, by 13 points in the tailored group and 19 points in the generic group. Counteracting the rise in LDL cholesterol level that women experience after menopause is a primary focus in preventing atherosclerosis and heart attacks. Women in the tailored group improved lower body strength by 21.2% from baseline to 12 months, whereas the generic group improved by 9.5%. Such improvements in fitness and strength have been shown to lower risk of functional decline and mortality in women.\nFor the secondary outcomes, there was no newsletter group difference in the achievement of HP 2010 physical activity and healthy eating behavioral criterion standards at 6 months. At 12 months, a significantly higher proportion of the tailored newsletter group had achieved three of the five outcome targets for eating and the outcome target for activity. However, at least 30% of the women in the tailored group and at least 47% of the women in the generic group did not meet each of the criterion standards. Considerably more work is needed to help midlife and older rural women to achieve a healthy lifestyle, as reflected by these standards.\nSeveral limitations to the study design are acknowledged. The measurement of behavioral markers of activity and eating by self-report may have been biased by social desirability of response, but those reports were supplemented by biomarkers. Generalizability was limited by the randomization of sites rather than participants to intervention groups. However, the possibility of cross-intervention contamination within rural communities where women in both groups would have a high likelihood of interaction at commercial and social settings was considered a greater threat to validity. The dearth of minorities in the areas from which participants were recruited also limits generalizability of results. However, the sample was representative q of a hard-to-reach older rural underserved population of women that has been an infrequent target of such intervention. Although random-digit dialing was employed to randomly select eligible women in the target counties, not all those contacted consented to participate, potentially biasing the sample in favor of those who had greater interest in changing their health behaviors. Although the use of random-digit dialing for recruitment may appear to limit inclusion of women without telephones, 97.6% of rural households had telephones at that time.\nMore than a quarter of older women live in rural areas, where the public health structure is often fragmented and underfunded if it exists at all. Access to healthcare in many rural areas is limited because of shortages of health professionals and the distances that women must travel to a provider. Many overworked and underreimbursed rural providers do not provide their clients with lifestyle modification advice. Thus, there is a need to expand access to lifestyle guidance with effective interventions delivered by methods other than face-to-face encounters, such as the distance model evaluated here. The considerable investment of time and resources required for computer tailoring seems justified by the greater changes in healthy eating and physical activity achieved. q\n",
