      "value": "Background: Programs promoting population health through physical activity (PA) and exposure to nature are popular, but few have been evaluated in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs).\nObjective: To investigate the effectiveness of a park prescription intervention (PPI) for improving total moderate-tovigorous PA (MVPA), other PA related behaviors, quality of life (QoL) and cardio-metabolic health among adults. Methods: Healthy individuals aged 40 to 65 years were recruited through community health screenings and randomly assigned to 1) PPI: face-to-face Park Prescription + invitation to weekly exercise sessions in parks, or 2) control: standard PA materials. After the six-month intervention, participants completed accelerometer assessments, questionnaires on health behaviors and QoL, and health screenings. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare outcomes between groups, with secondary analysis adjusted for co-variates via multiple linear regression. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Eighty participants were allocated to each group. Participants with mean age of 51.1 (Standard Deviation: 6.3) years were predominantly female (79%) and of Chinese ethnicity (81%). Participation in the group exercise started at 48% and declined to 24% by week 26. At six-months, 145 (91%) participants attended health screenings for outcome measure collection, and 126 (79%) provided valid accelerometer data. Time spent in MVPA favored the PPI group but this difference was not statistically significant (4.4 (− 43.8, 52.7) minutes/week; when removing 2 extreme outliers 26.8 (− 9.7, 63.4) minutes/week). Time spent in parks (147.5 (2.1, 292.9) minutes/month), PA in parks (192.5 (59.5, 325.5) minutes/month), and recreational PA (48.7 (1.4, 96.0) minutes/week) were significantly greater in the PPI group. PPI also significantly improved psychological QoL (4.0 (0.0, 8.0).",

      "value": "In Asia, non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention is a priority for governments to act upon and physical inactivity is a major contributing factor to increases in NCD. About 25% of adults globally and 15% in South-East Asia do not achieve the recommended amounts of physical activity (PA) (at least 150 min of moderateintensity, or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic PA per week, or an equivalent combination of the two). Studies among adult Singaporeans also illustrated that about 25% of adults are insufficiently active and that middleaged people exercise the least.\nReviews have consistently identified epidemiological evidence of health benefits associated with exposure to parks and other green space, including reduced negative mental health outcomes, lower levels of overweight/obesity, lower levels of cardiovascular disease, reduced prevalence of type II diabetes and reduced mortality. The World Health Organization accordingly recommended a systems approach including a focus on active environments and the creation of high-quality green spaces to promote PA and population health. Despite the accumulating epidemiological evidence and these recent recommendations, the lack of sufficiently high-quality evidence on the association between green spaces and health from prospective studies has been frequently highlighted. More importantly, creating green spaces may not be sufficient on its own because many people cannot or do not want to spend time in nature for various reasons. Systematic reviews of interventions aiming to promote the use of parks, green spaces, and PA in urban green spaces have illustrated important gaps in the evidence: a very small number of studies overall, studies that are usually of low methodological quality, and interventions that mainly focus on the creation or modification of green spaces. Thus, it was repeatedly emphasized that understanding the mechanisms of exposure to nature and human health requires robust evidence through rigorous evaluations of interventions.\nThe recently published Global Action Plan on Physical Activity highlights the need for more evidence-based PA programmes in parks. The Park Prescription concept emerged from the collaboration between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Recreation and Parks Association. In 2013 'Park Prescriptions' were defined as 'Programs designed in collaboration with healthcare providers . . . to utilize parks, trails and open space for improving . . . community health'. Park prescription programs have become increasingly popular because they promote the use of parks and it is believed that this can improve health through the combined benefits of greater PA while being exposed to or interacting with nature. Park prescription also incorporates the concept of exercise prescription, which has been found to increase PA levels among inactive patients. Whilst there have been studies of prescribing PA in parks, including one randomized-controlled trial (RCT) among parents of children with a high rate of chronic conditions, to our knowledge no RCT has provided evidence for this kind of intervention in the general population.\nSingapore has more than 400 parks, which are well maintained and well distributed across the island. Due to its greenery and easy access to parks and green spaces it is also referred to 'a city in a garden'. However, research has shown that 63% of Singaporeans visit parks and green spaces only twice per month or even less and few reported to engage in active sports in parks. The Singapore context creates an opportunity to explore the application of the novel and increasingly popular approach of Park Prescription to the general population.\nThe Park Prescription Trial was conceptualized to address the research evidence gaps and evaluate a carefully developed park prescription intervention (PPI), implemented in the context of community health screenings free to middle-aged adult Singaporeans. The objectives of the trial were a) to determine the effectiveness of PPI on PA related behaviours (including the primary outcome, accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous PA), time spent in parks and PA in parks, as well as mental well-being and physical health outcomes, and b) to understand the mechanisms of impact of the PPI through a comprehensive process evaluation using qualitative and quantitative methods. The current study reports on the effectiveness of the PPI.\n",

      "value": "The Park Prescription Trial was a parallel group, two-arm RCT with 1:1 allocation ratio to either intervention or control arm. The RCT was conducted in the community setting in Singapore and participants were recruited following community health screenings free to Singaporean nationals and residents. At the time of the study, health screenings took place across the entire city and participants for the present RCT were recruited from screenings conducted by a large hospital with a catchment population in the northern part of Singapore. Health screenings, together with the recruitment process to our study, had been previously described in detail. Briefly, screening events followed a systematic approach at common community outdoor open spaces or community centers, followed by separate sessions during which residents picked-up their health report. Ina first step, participants were approached by the research team based on results from health screening. Ina second step, the adapted Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaires (referred to as PAR-Q2) was administered by the research team, which included additional sections to formally assess subjects' age, whether they were pregnant, whether they had physical disabilities or lower limb disorders and the time they spent exercising on a weekly basis.\nAfter completion of health screening and the PAR-Q2, individuals were enrolled in the Park Prescription Trial if they met the following criteria: Singapore citizen or permanent resident; aged 40-65 years; self-reported weekly exercise < 150 min per week; systolic blood pressure ≤ 139 mmHG and diastolic blood pressure ≤ 89 mmHG; fasting glucose level ≤ 6.0 mmol/l; pass the adapted Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q); able to write and read in English or Chinese; and, provide written informed consent.\nAfter confirming eligibility, participants were randomized (maintaining allocation concealment) into one of the two arms based on computer-generated random sequence using STATA statistical software version 12. Block sizes were generated randomly using a minimum block size of four and a maximum block size often. Participants in both arms completed assessments at baseline (prior to randomization), three-month, mid-intervention follow-up, and upon completion of the intervention at the six-month follow-up. This trial and all its associated forms and resources have been approved by the National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB) in Singapore [2015/00611-Park Prescription Trial] and informed consent involved the participants reviewing a participant information sheet, before receiving a brief overview of the study.

They completed a park prescription sheet with a trained study team member during counseling, where they committed to a goal which specified the frequency, intensity, time and location of exercise in parks. Participants subsequently received information brochures about parks in their neighborhood and a sheet to plan their weekly PA in parks. One brochure that was specifically developed for the trial provided information on the main parks in the northern part of Singapore (within communities where participants were recruited from community screenings) and their features, including walking trails (with time needed to complete them) and locations of fitness corners. The other brochure was a general brochure from the Singapore National Parks Board containing a map and information on the Northern Explorer Loop (a series of parks in Singapore's north connected by a network of walking and cycling paths). The participants also received a planning sheet, where they filled in the types of activities they aimed to do each week over the trial period. Half-way through the trial a trained study team member provided a brief counselling phone call. The counselling assessed progress towards set goals and included modification of those goals if necessary. In addition, participants were invited to join a weekly one-hour outdoor structured and supervised physical activity program in the park fora period of 6 months. Each one-hour session comprised moderate intensity aerobic activity and strength and balance exercises. The structured PA program took place on one weekday evening and on Sunday mornings in public parks located in the participants' neighborhood. The sessions utilized different areas and features of the parks, including walking trails and open spaces, to maximize participants' exposure to greenery. To encourage attendance, participants received Short Message Service (SMS) reminders prior to each weekly exercise session.\n",

If there were less than 4 days, the participant was asked to wear another accelerometer for another seven consecutive days. Data were collected at a rate of 80 Hz and downloaded in raw format (ActiLife version 6.13). Raw data were processed in R using the GGIR package (version 1.6-0). Raw tri-axial accelerometer signals were auto-calibrated and converted into gravity-corrected vector magnitude units, termed the Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO). Accelerometer wear time inclusion criteria were a minimum of 16 h/ day for at least 3 days. Non-wear time was estimated based on the standard deviation and value range of each accelerometer axis, using a 60-min window with 15-min increments. For each 15-min period detected as nonwear time over the valid wearing days, the invalid data were imputed using the mean value of valid data at same time points on other days. We used acceleration intensity thresholds (mg) to classify activity during waking time into SB (ENMO≤25.0 mg), light PA (LPA, ENMO 25.0-100.0 mg) and MVPA (ENMO> 100.0 mg).\n",

Descriptive statistics are presented for demographic variables of the PPI and control groups at baseline using mean and standard deviation for variables that are normally distributed, median and interquartile range for skewed continuous variables, and frequency and proportions for categorical variables.

      "value": "PA in a natural environment is intuitively good for health and interventions which include a 'natural exposure' component have received increasing attention in recent years. The current RCT was designed to strengthen the existing evidence and evaluate the effectiveness of a PPI among inactive but healthy communitybased, 40-65-year-old adults on behavioral and health outcomes, including accelerometer-measured PA. In that context, results of PPI on behavioral and health related outcomes were mixed. While PPI resulted in consistent improvements in PA, the effect on the primary outcome of objectively measured total MVPA and on objectively measured total volume of PA (mean ENMO) were smaller than expected and failed to reach statistical significance. On the other hand, PPI resulted in meaningful and statistically significant increases in key secondary outcomes, including recreational PA, time spent in parks, and PA in parks. Additionally, PPI achieved improvements in selected measures of QoL and wellbeing, especially psychological QoL, but it had no effect on cardio-metabolic outcomes.\nConsidering the increasing interest in park prescription programs in many countries, findings from this RCT provide important new evidence. To our knowledge, the only other RCT of a PPI was conducted by Razani and colleagues among low income families with parents and children who were clinic patients and had high rates of chronic illness. The study reported significant improvements in stress levels among parents after 3 months. However, it did not directly investigate the effectiveness of park prescriptions because both  intervention groups received park prescriptions delivered by a pediatrician, a postcard with a map of local parks, a pedometer and a journal. The 'supported' group differed from the 'independent' group with regard to three outings involving free transportation, phone and text reminders, food, and other activities. Elley and colleagues conducted a high-quality cluster RCT which evaluated a similar concept of PA counselling plus exercise prescriptions without a focus on parks and green spaces among more than 800 middle-aged patients of general practitioners in New Zealand. The authors reported significant albeit slightly lower increases in leisure-time PA when compared to our findings. Ina previous systematic review Hunter et al., identified 12 studies evaluating interventions that aimed to increase the use of urban green spaces and PA behavior. The majority of these studies evaluated environmental interventions and the authors identified only one RCT of high-quality. It reported significant increases in the amount of PA of park visitors and the frequency of exercise in parks. These results appear broadly consistent with observed significant increases in park use, PA in parks and recreational PA in our trial, but the earlier RCT did not assess total MVPA via accelerometers or self-report.\nThe authors of the systematic review concluded that interventions aiming to increase the use of urban green spaces maybe effective, but they highlighted the need for rigorous evaluations of interventions aiming to promote the use of urban green spaces and PA. They further recommended that such evaluations should, among others, pay attention to appropriate sample size estimations, control group designs, and objective outcome assessments.\nThe present PPI was carefully designed based on extensive formative research to take population-specific barriers to PA and park use in a busy middle-aged working  population into consideration. We also identified comparatively large increases in recreational PA and PA in parks associated with the intervention. Despite the increases in park PA and recreational MVPA, the effect on bouted MVPA (regardless of measured objectively or via self-report) was not statistically significant after 6 months. Several factors could explain this. For instance, the decline in adherence to exercise sessions, which decreased to 24% by the end of the study. It is also possible that the exercise sessions were not of sufficient continuity or intensity to translate into increases in bouted MVPA. Throughout the formative research phase intensity and duration of exercise sessions emerged as a potentially controversial issue.\nWhile the goal of the project was to increase bouted MVPA, formative research findings suggested a preference of potential participants for less intensive and short exercise sessions. Although coaches were instructed according to the project goals, this may ultimately also have resulted in insufficiently intense and/or continuous engagement by intervention group participants, especially if they decided not to attend the sessions but instead exercised by themselves, which was highlighted as another preference by a number of participants during formative research. Hence, the intervention may have had a greater effect if it had promoted options for unstructured activity more intensively to better support PPI participants who did not attend exercise sessions regularly. Despite the screening of eligible participants including a criterion that they were physically inactive, we also noted that participants self-reported MVPA at baseline was relatively high. This could have limited the opportunities of PPI to achieve expected increases in objectively measured PA. Similarly, engagement in park PA prior to the start of the intervention and a preference for non-park PA despite enrolling in this study may also have limited the overall effect of our intervention. This was anticipated to some extent and addressed by the results of the pre-specified subgroup analysis according to baseline engagement in PA in parks. The findings of the subgroup analysis were somewhat inconsistent. PPI demonstrated considerably greater effects on accelerometer-measured PA outcomes among individuals who had previously reported to engage in PA in parks, while the effect on self-reported outcomes of recreational PA, park visits, and PA in parks was greater among participants who had not previously engaged in park PA. This could suggest that individuals who already use parks for PA can be encouraged to engage in greater and higher intensity PA (bouted MVPA) but that those who do not usually engage in park PA may only increase their park use and park PA somewhat, but not in ways that would also translate into greater bouted MVPA.\nOverall, these points of discussion suggest that certain modifications to the developed park prescription program and/or the target population may help to improve its effectiveness. Especially since the participation rates in the group exercise sessions were low, which suggests that other elements of the intervention (all of which had almost 100% participation) may have been a mechanism for these effects. We explore this and other mechanisms of impact for the intervention on its outcomes in a separate process evaluation (not yet published) which may inform such modifications.\nIn addition to the effects on PA and park use, there is increasing interest in the health benefits of parks and other urban green spaces because epidemiological evidence suggests that exposure to green spaces in urban environments is associated with physical and mental health benefits. However, there remains alack of methodologically rigorous prospective studies. The Park Prescription Trial investigated distress, wellbeing and physical health outcomes as secondary outcomes to strengthen the existing evidence base. The trial demonstrated improvements in selected wellbeing outcomes, particularly psychological wellbeing. No improvements were observed in relation to psychological distress and cardio-metabolic outcomes. To our knowledge, there is no consensus as to what constitutes a recommended amount or clinically meaningful increase in park use and PA in parks. However, the effect of the PPI on these behaviours was substantial and greater than inmost previous studies aiming to promote park use and PA in parks. While our results in relation to health outcomes appear to differ from the only other park prescription intervention study that reported reduced stress levels, this maybe a reflection of very different target populations. Recreational PA is also known to be associated with positive cardio-metabolic outcomes. Given the considerable increases in recreational PA and PA in parks, the lack of effects of PPI on other health outcomes apart from psychological QoL may appear surprising. However, considering a healthy population with no existing cardio-metabolic diseases and low distress levels, the duration and possibly the intensity of the PA may simply not have been enough to achieve improvements in these outcomes. In fact, the previously cited cluster-RCT of exercise prescriptions, for instance, made similar observations with no effects on cardio-metabolic and positive effects only on selected QoL outcomes. Similarly, considering that our study was not powered to provide definitive evidence for the effects of PPI on wellbeing further prospective and sufficiently large studies are warranted to confirm our observations. The Park Prescription Trial has several strengths, including the RCT design, adequate sample size, allocation concealment, objective and valid outcome measures and a sufficiently long follow-up. The trial is also conducted in a community setting and thus more likely to reflect real-life effectiveness than strictly controlled efficacy studies. This and the availability of health screenings across Singapore also increase the chances of the intervention being appropriate for scaling up to benefit larger segments of the population. Some limitations are also associated with the trial. Due to the study being embedded in ongoing community health screenings we were notable to collect accelerometer data of the primary outcome at baseline. We addressed this by controlling for self-report total PA in the secondary analysis of the primary outcome, but some small risk of unmeasured confounding remains. Blinding of participants or outcome assessors was also not possible, which we tried to address by using objective and validated measures for outcome assessments wherever possible. It is also conceivable that some contamination effects may have occurred by participants allocated to PPI group sharing information or materials with control group participants. While we tried to minimize this risk by excluding family members of existing participants from enrolment and by holding 'closed group' exercise sessions in parks, a minimal risk remains. However, contamination would likely result in conservative estimates of the intervention effectiveness. Furthermore, this trial was conducted in the context of community health screenings in the northern part of Singapore, which are available only to middle-aged Singaporeans and permanent residents residing in this area. Our study population is therefore not representative of the general adult population in Singapore. However, it seemed to be similar to participants of a previous survey at community health screenings. Moreover, while the study was conducted in the north of the country, Singapore has a large number of parks and green spaces that are easy to access and well distributed across the island. We also compared key characteristics of our study population with information reported in recent national census data. With regards to education level, the proportion of participants working and average household income, our study population appeared broadly similar to the adult population in Singapore. While the proportion of Chinese in our study was slightly greater and that of Malay smaller, the proportion of participants with Indian ethnicity was also similar to that in the general population. There was also no follow-up beyond 6 months, therefore longer term effects of the intervention are unknown. Finally, the distribution of certain outcome variables was skewed. Thus, we further implemented natural log-transformation on these variables to normalize data. However, the results were largely consistent with the prespecified analyses, with conclusions remaining unchanged.\n",

      "value": "Park Prescription is a novel approach to promoting time spent in nature and participation in PA for better wellbeing and health. The Park Prescription Trial appears to be the first RCT that has investigated the effectiveness of a park prescription intervention in a communitydwelling population, with some positive yet somewhat inconsistent outcomes. PPI was able to achieve substantial increases in park use, PA in parks and recreational PA, but did not achieve significant increases in the primary outcome objectively measured bouted MVPA. In this healthy, middle-aged population the trial furthermore provides evidence for possible beneficial effects of the intervention on QoL but not for psychological distress and cardio-metabolic outcomes. Prospective longitudinal studies with adequate sample size are warranted to confirm the demonstrated findings in relation to the health effects of PA in urban green spaces.\n",
