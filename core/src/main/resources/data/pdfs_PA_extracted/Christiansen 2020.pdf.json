      "value": "Objective. To explore the feasibility, delity, safety, and preliminary outcomes of a physical therapist-administered physical activity (PA) intervention after total knee replacement (TKR).\nMethods. People who had undergone a unilateral TKR and were receiving outpatient physical therapy (PT) were randomized to a control or intervention group. Both groups received standard PT for TKR. The intervention included being provided with a Fitbit Zip, step goals, and 1 phone calla month for 6 months after discharge from PT. Feasibility was measured by rates of recruitment and retention, safety was measured by the frequency of adverse events, and delity was measured by adherence to the weekly steps/day goal created by the physical therapist and participant monitoring of steps/day. An Actigraph GT3X measured PA, which was quanti ed as steps/day and minutes/week of engaging in moderate-to-vigorous PA. Our preliminary outcome was the difference in PA 6 months after discharge from PT between the control and intervention groups.\nResults. Of the 43 individuals who were enrolled, 53.4% were women, the mean ± SD age was 67.0 ± 7.0 years, and the mean ± SD body mass index was 31.5 ± 5.9 kg/m . For both the control and intervention groups, the recruitment and retention rates were 64% and 83.7%, respectively, and adherence to the intervention ranged from 45% to 60%. No study-related adverse events occurred. The patients in the intervention group accumulated a mean 1,798 more steps/day (95% con dence interval [95% CI] 240, 3,355) and spent 73.4 more minutes/week (95% CI -14.1, 160.9) engaging in moderate-to-vigorous PA at 6 months than those in the control group.\nA physical therapist-administered PA intervention is feasible and safe, demonstrates treatment delity, and may increase PA after TKR. Future research is needed to establish the effectiveness of the intervention.\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02724137.",

      "value": "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability in older adults. Total knee replacement (TKR) is the de nitive treatment for knee OA that resolves most knee pain and limitations in physical function. However, physical activity (PA), which is de ned as anybody movement that results in energy expenditure above a resting level, remains mostly unchanged after TKR and leaves individuals who have undergone TKR at risk of inactivity-related health problems after surgery, such as weight gain, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and premature death. The number of TKR surgeries, which have doubled over the past 15 years in the US, is expected to increase substantially; more than 3.5 million TKRs are expected to be performed every year by 2030. Thus, there is a critical need to improve PA in individuals after TKR.\nOutpatient physical therapy (PT) is an optimal setting to deliver a PA intervention. Physical therapists are experts in prescribing and tailoring therapeutic exercise programs to promote PA. After TKR, physical therapists often treat patients in an outpatient setting 2-3 times a week for 6 to 8 weeks as part of standard postoperative care, which aligns with the recommended frequency of one-on-one visits that are needed to promote behavioral change to increase PA. Furthermore, >90% of patients in PT agree that physical therapists should discuss PA as apart of care.\nRecording steps/day with an activity tracker, e.g., a Fitbit Zip (Fitbit, Inc.), and receiving weekly steps/day goals from a healthcare professional has been shown to increase PA. This type of intervention increases PA through a behavioral change technique that includes feedback from the activity tracker and self-monitoring of the goal. At present, it is not known if a physical therapist-administered PA intervention is feasible and safe and demonstrates delity. Additionally, it is not known if such an intervention can increase PA in people after TKR. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility, safety, delity, and preliminary outcomes of a physical therapist-administered PA intervention after TKR.\n",

Standard PT also included a printed home exercise program with an exercise log that was updated weekly by the physical therapist (see Supplementary Table, available at http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/ doi/10.1002/acr.23882/ abstract). Participants in the control group also received a monthly phone call for 6 months after discharge from PT to discuss their overall health and to serve as a reminder for the PA data collection at 6 months and 12 months. These calls also served to match the number of points of contact between the intervention and control groups. Weekly steps/day goals and feedback on PA was not provided to control group participants.\nIntervention group. The intervention group received a Fitbit Zip, weekly steps/day goal from a physical therapist, and monthly follow-up phone calls from a research assistant (for 6 months) to promote PA. In addition, the intervention group was provided with the same standard outpatient PT of the control group.\nFitbit Zip (activity tracker). A Fitbit Zip was provided within 1 week of enrolling in the study. Participants were given written and face-to-face instructions on how to setup, use, and sync the Fitbit Zip to their smartphone, tablet, or home computer using the app provided by Fitbit. If the participant did not have a smartphone, tablet, or home computer, they were instructed to use the Fitbit Zip as a pedometer. We asked participants to wear the Fitbit Zip around their waist at their right anterior superior iliac crest daily (during waking hours) and to monitor their steps/day count with the Fitbit Zip and record steps/day count in their home exercise program. Extra batteries and instructions on how to install the batteries were provided as needed. After the 6-month followup, participants returned their Fitbit Zip to the research team.\nWeekly steps/day goal setting.

      "value": "• Outpatient physical therapy (PT) is an ideal setting to increase physical activity (PA) because physical therapists are experts in exercise and commonly see patients after total knee replacement (TKR) for multiple visits; however, it is unclear if a PA intervention in PT is feasible and safe, demonstrates fidelity, and can increase PA in individuals after TKR. • We found the physical therapist-administered PA intervention to be feasible and safe and to have modest fidelity. Moreover, we observed clinically meaningful increases in PA among those in the intervention group. • Study participants receiving the intervention reached levels of PA that were consistent with the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, and the majority of those in the intervention walked >6,000 steps/day (a level needed to prevent the development of functional limitation) 6 months after discharge from PT.\nto walk at least 6,000 steps/day until discharge. We used this as a goal because this threshold is known to protect against development of functional limitation in people with knee OA. If the participant achieved 6,000 steps/day, they were encouraged to continue to increase their steps/day since health bene ts persist with more PA. Weekly steps/day goals were recorded on a standardized goalsetting form and a home exercise program log (see Supplementary Table, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.23882/ abstract).\nMonthly follow-up phone calls. A research assistant contacted participants in the intervention group once a month for 6 months and continued jointly setting steps/day goals with the study participant after discharge from PT. The purpose of the phone calls once a month for 6 months was to provide additional PA goal setting after discharge from PT. A research assistant, instead of a physical therapist, called participants because this model of delivery is more feasible in the clinical practice.\nBaseline participant characteristics. Using electronic medical records, research assistants extracted self-reported health history, demographic characteristics, worst knee pain on a visual analog scale (VAS), and objective knee range of motion (ROM) measurements that were collected by a licensed physical therapist at the initial PT evaluation (i.e., our study baseline). Quantifying worst knee pain using a VAS is a valid and reliable method to assess pain. ROM was measured with the participant in supine position using a standardized goniometer, with the axis positioned at the lateral epicondyle, the stationary arm inline with the greater trochanter, and the moveable arm aligned with the lateral malleolus.\nFeasibility, safety, and fidelity. We assessed feasibility by evaluating recruitment and retention rates. The recruitment rate was calculated as the number of participants who enrolled in the study divided by the number of people who were screened for eligibility at UDPT. The retention rate was calculated as the number of participants who completed the study from baseline to 6 months divided by the total number of enrolled participants. We measured delity 2 ways, including the physical therapist's adherence to administering the intervention (establishing a weekly steps/day goal with the participant) and the participant's ability to adhere to the intervention (monitoring steps/day). Adherence to administering the weekly steps/day goal by the physical therapist was measured by a research assistant counting the number of goals documented in the home exercise program log from baseline to discharge from PT. We classi ed adherence as \"achieved\" for participants who had ≥80% of the weekly steps/day goal recorded by the physical therapist and \"not achieved\" for those with <80% of the weekly steps/day goals recorded, which is consistent with the de nition of adherence from a pharmacologic perspective. Participants documented the number of days they recorded steps/day using the Fitbit Zip, and those with ≥80% of documented steps/day in the home exercise program log from baseline to discharge were classi ed as \"achieved\" adherence and those with <80% as \"not achieved.\" Lastly, we assessed safety by reporting the number of adverse events recorded from baseline to months. An adverse event was de ned as any unfavorable or unintended diagnosis, sign, symptom, or disease associated with the study, which mayor may not be related to the intervention. PA measures. PA was objectively measured using the Actigraph GT3X, which is a reliable and valid measurement of PA in older adults after TKR. PA was quanti ed in units of steps/ day and time spent engaging in moderate-to-vigorous PA/week. Participants wore the monitor on the waist, positioned at the right anterior superior iliac spine, from the time they got up in the morning until they went to sleep. The participants were also instructed to remove the monitor when the device could get wet (e.g., showering, swimming). Participants wore the monitor for 1 week at baseline, discharge, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up (Figure). Data from the Actigraph GT3X were downloaded and analyzed following a standardized protocol (https ://epi.grants. cancer.gov/nhanes_pam/) reported by Troiano et al. Brie y, we de ned a valid wear day as ≥10 hours of wear time, excluding time with ≥90 consecutive minutes of <100 activity counts, and we only included PA data with ≥4 valid wear days.\n",

Between March 2016 and June 2017, 67 individuals were screened after having unilateral TKR, of whom 43 were eligible for the study and were enrolled and randomized (Table). The recruitment rate was 64% (43 of 67 participants) (Figure). The overall retention rate was 83.7% (36 of 43 participants) at 6 months and was 67% (29 of 43 participants) at 12 months (Figure). During the study, 3 adverse events occurred with participants in the control group. One participant had adverse events by injuring the contralateral knee and bruising a tendon in the back of the ipsilateral knee between the 6-month and 12-month follow-up visits. Another participant was diagnosed with gout in the rst metatarsal joint during PT. All adverse events were unrelated to the PA intervention. Sixty percent (12 of 20 participants) of those in the intervention group monitored steps/day at least 80% of the time while in PT, while 45% of physical therapists (9 of 20) were in adherence with the administration of the intervention by documenting weekly steps/day goals ≥80% of the time.).

      "value": "We found that a physical therapist-administered PA intervention was feasible and safe and had modest delity. Also, the intervention was potentially effective for people after TKR, which was demonstrated by our ndings of improvements in PA that met clinically meaningful levels. For instance, the intervention group walked about 6,000 steps/day after discharge from outpatient PT, which is a meaningful threshold for reducing the risk of functional limitation in people with knee OA. In contrast, the control group walked about the same amount as the general population, i.e., ~4,000 steps/day. Moreover, the intervention group spent >150 minutes/week engaging in moderate-to-vigorous PA at discharge and at the 6-month follow-up visit, meeting the 2018 Department of Health and Human Services PA guidelines for aerobic activity. Our results show promise in informing ways to change behavior that leads to inactivity and subsequent weight gain that are common after TKR.\nDespite increases in PA, adherence to the intervention was modest from both participants and treating physical therapists. Less than half of the physical therapists (45%) documented that they consistently provided weekly steps/day goals, and 60% of participants monitored their steps/day. While we were unable to track how often patients looked at their Fitbit Zip, it is possible that self-monitoring steps/day from a device with a daily goal maybe more useful to increase PA than a weekly goal given by a PT. The intervention was safe, as no participants in the intervention group reported an adverse event. We also noted that the monthly phone calls made by a research assistant from the 6-month to the 12-month follow-up did not result in a noticeable change in PA.\nOur ndings, that use of a Fitbit Zip monitor in conjunction with step goals was feasible and safe, showed good delity, and could increase PA after TKR, are consistent with other studies. A study by Losina et al demonstrated that nancial incentives combined with telephone health coaching and a Fitbit led to a clinically meaningful increase in steps/day within the rst 6 months after TKR. Furthermore, our nding that PA did not change from 6 to 12 months after surgery is consistent with the literature. Ina meta-analysis, Hammett et al observed no change in PA at 6 months after TKR, with only a small change in PA at 12 months (3). Both the control and intervention groups in our study had no signi cant differences in PA from discharge to 6-month and 12-month follow-up visits, indicating that providing a PA intervention during outpatient PT maybe an optimal time to improve PA.\nStrengths of our study included measuring PA using an accelerometer-enabled device and a brief PA intervention. Our intervention took roughly 5 minutes/week to set and progress weekly steps/day goals, which improved the feasibility for clinical implementation. However, our study was not without limitations. We had a small sample size with a moderate dropout rate at 12 months. The dropout rate was equal between the control and intervention groups, with most participants dropping out after the 6-month follow-up visit. This rate indicates that a study follow-up of more than 6 months maybe challenging in this patient population. Since this was a pilot study (i.e., we sought to determine feasibility, safety, and delity), we felt it was acceptable to have a small and underpowered sample size. There was high variability around the number of days after surgery that participants started outpatient PT and enrolled in our study; the mean ± SD days after TKR that participants enrolled in the study was 14 ± 21 days, and the range was 2-175 days. Outpatient PT typically commences between 2 and 12 weeks after TKR, and the time postsurgery when participants enrolled in our study was within this range. Therefore, this variability is expected. Lastly, we only included people after TKR who were interested in increasing their PA, which may have limited the generalizability of our sample. We did so because those who are not interested in PA may require additional behavioral change techniques (e.g., motivational interviewing) to increase PA, which was not feasible in our study.\nOverall, a physical therapist-administered PA intervention was feasible and safe, demonstrated modest delity, and promoted an increase in PA after TKR that appeared to remain for up to 12 months after discharge from PT. Our preliminary ndings suggest that PT may indeed be a practical delivery model fora PA intervention after TKR. Given these study ndings, further research is needed, with appropriate power, to establish the effectiveness of this intervention.\n",
