      "value": "Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is highly effective as secondary prevention for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Uptake of CR remains suboptimal (30% of eligible patients), and long-term adherence to a physically active lifestyle is even lower. Innovative strategies are needed to counteract this phenomenon. Objective: The Physical Activity Toward Health (PATHway) system was developed to provide a comprehensive, remotely monitored, home-based CR program for CVD patients. The PATHway-I study aimed to investigate its feasibility and clinical efficacy during phase III CR. Methods: Participants were randomized on a 1:1 basis to the PATHway (PW) intervention group or usual care (UC) control group in a single-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled pilot trial. Outcomes were assessed at completion of phase II CR and 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was physical activity (PA; Actigraph GT9X link). Secondary outcomes included measures of physical fitness, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, endothelial function, intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery, and quality of life. System usability and patients' experiences were evaluated only in PW. A mixed-model analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustment was used to analyze between-group effects overtime. Missing values were handled by means of an intention-to-treat analysis. Statistical significance was set at a 2-sided alpha level of .05. Data are reported as mean (SD). Results: A convenience sample of 120 CVD patients (mean 61.4 years, SD 13.5 years; 22 women) was included. The PATHway system was deployed in the homes of 60 participants. System use decreased overtime and system usability was average with a score of 65.7 (SD 19.7;",

      "value": "Globally, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is responsible for over 17.3 million deaths annually and accounts for 45% of noncommunicable deaths. In Europe, over 1.4 million people die prematurely from cardiovascular-related diseases with a projected 25% increase in the incidence of CVD by 2030. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an important component of the current multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with various presentations of CVD. Despite the growing evidence of the benefits and importance of CR, uptake remains low with only 30% of eligible patients taking part in an ambulatory center-based CR program and only 50% of those maintaining an active lifestyle 6 months after completion of the program.\nThe reason for low participation rate is multifactorial and includes time constraints, poor accessibility, transportation issues, lack of motivation to change behavior, and low self-efficacy. Home-based programs have proven to be safe and effective and have enormous potential to widen access to CR. Furthermore, home-based CR increases self-efficacy to participate in exercise, leading to better adherence to a physically active lifestyle in comparison with usual care groups. However, home-based CR interventions often fail to combine the core components of center-based CR into one intervention. These core components are identified as exercise, education, and psychosocial support.\nWearable sensors, often worn as a wristband or embedded in a smartwatch or mobile phone, are now ubiquitous and provide real-time activity and physiological information that allows patients to monitor and adjust physical activity (PA) levels and exercise intensity to meet their rehabilitation goals. Many CVD patients have internet access, use wearable sensors, and have a high interest in technology-enabled home-based CR. In addition, low cost, motion-capturing cameras can facilitate the execution of appropriate movement patterns in the home. Frederix et al identified telemonitoring, e-learning, telecoaching, and social networking as the main focus areas of an effective telerehabilitation intervention, but only 16% of publications about telerehabilitation combined 2 focus areas and only 5% combined more than 2 focus areas.\n",

The results of the CPET were used to determine the individual training heart rates, which were then entered into the PATHway system. Each participant was guided to train at a heart rate between their first and second ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2). Heart rate zones were adjusted according to the results of the 3-month follow-up CPET. Participants were encouraged to achieve the PA goal of 150 min of moderate intensity PA per week according to prevailing guidelines. Different exercise modalities (Exerclass, Exergame, Active lifestyle activity) were available to the participant to achieve this goal. In addition, participants in PW were able to set goals for other lifestyle behaviors, that is, smoking, diet, alcohol consumption, stress, and medication adherence. For each of these goals, the participants had the option to log their behavior and to receive personalized, automatically generated text messages or emails to support adherence and progress toward achieving the goal(s).\nParticipants allocated to UC received verbal advice on how to best maintain PA and a heart-healthy lifestyle after completion of the center-based CR program.

      "value": "RenderX from larger trials. Our effect on MVPA did not translate into a positive effect on exercise capacity, the parameter most strongly related to morbidity and mortality, indicating that this effect might not be large enough to be clinically meaningful, at least not in this short timeframe of 6 months. Interestingly, daily MVPA at both baseline and 6 months were more than 3 times greater than the values reported by Prince et al regarding CR graduates (63.6 [SD 9.6] years, 75% male, peak VO 2 after CR of 25.2 [SD 6.6] mL/min/kg) wearing Actigraph GT3X accelerometer at the hip during waking hours. Participants in this study wore the Actigraph GT9X Link on the nondominant wrist for 24 h/day. Research shows that more accurate MVPA results are obtained when the device is worn on the hip compared with the wrist, which might in part be due to the lack of validated accelerometry algorithms for wrist-worn devices. As such, daily MVPA found in this study may have been overestimated. In line with this thought, high MVPA values were also found in a sample of obese individuals wearing the Actigraph GT3X at the wrist.\nFor physical fitness as well as most other outcome measures, we could only document trivial (<.2) effect sizes. Because participants were on average quite fit (96% of predicted sedentary values) at completion of phase II CR, no further improvement in physical fitness was to be expected. Contrary to our hypothesis, whereby we expected a larger decrease in physical fitness in UC, both groups were able to maintain their level of physical fitness. The lack of differences between both groups could be attributable to the small study groups, the motivation to remain fit because of the scheduled follow-up testing as well as the relatively short time period of the trial.\nOn the other hand, the hypothesized deterioration in UC did occur in relation to the cardiovascular risk score and diastolic blood pressure. Both increased significantly in UC (P=.003 and P<.001, respectively), while remaining stable in PW and this resulted in significant differences between groups overtime. A potential explanation for this finding might be the use of the behavior change module in PW. This module is based on 22 behavior change techniques that can help increase compliance to healthy behaviors and thus have an influence on total cardiovascular risk score. However, our data cannot support this assumption, as the choice to set healthy living goals was not statistically translated into better outcome scores.\nParticipants' usage of the PATHway system decreased overtime, with the decline starting in the 4th month. Weaknesses of the chosen heart rate tracker, as well as the rather limited suite of exercises/games incorporated into the PATHway system may have been a contributing factor to the decline in usage. Studies examining the use of PA trackers to maintain levels of PA also indicate a gradual decrease in usage, with a sustainability of the use of this technology ranging from 129 days to 5 to 7 months. Factors that increase sustained technology use include ease of use, absence of technology failure, high educational background, younger age, and female gender. It is important to note that use of technology is not necessarily equal to adherence to a desired health behavior. We reported the participants' engagement with the PATHway system by means of usage data, but engagement is a complex construct and should likely be measured by a combination of methods, which are also context dependent.\nTo maximize engagement, usability, and adherence, the PATHway system was developed in consultation with the target users. The majority of the study participants found PATHway easy to use. However, software problems were identified when the system was first deployed in the participant's home. The software issues were resolved with 2 major updates during the study, resulting in a more mature system emerging during the later phase of the trial. It is likely that persistent technology-related issues may have frustrated the study participants and have had a negative impact on the use of the system. In line with this thought, the debrief interviews that will be described in detail separately, documented the need for future improvements and expansion to increase the longevity of this mode of CR delivery. In agreement with Hermsen et al, we also found that younger CR patients were more likely than older patients to participate in the study. Although almost 90% of participants in PW had completed secondary education and 50% had a higher education degree, we did not find a significant relation between PATHway usage and educational level.\nThe documented decrease in exercise self-efficacy may also help explain a decrease in use of technology. It is possible that baseline self-efficacy scores are too optimistic because at the time of baseline measurements, the study participants were still participating in supervised, very structured, and well-organized phase II CR. When the participants graduated from CR and needed to implement an exercise routine in their home environment, they may have come to a better understanding of the requirements and challenges of exercise self-efficacy, resulting in lower scores. On the other hand, one might also argue that reaching daily PA goals could also give the participant the feeling he/she no longer needs the PATHway technology to remain physically active. Indeed, the decrease in PATHway usage did not result in a decrease in the daily MVPA and physical fitness.\nThe study participants in this project were predominantly men, as is inline with how men and women are distributed in ambulatory CR in todays practice in the hospitals participating in this trial. One reason for this might be that the ambulatory CR program in its current format is more appealing to men, compared with women. Furthermore, there is some evidence that women are also significantly less likely to be referred for CR programs following revascularization compared with men. Advances in cardiovascular research is documenting sex-specific differences with regard to diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. To be able to draw conclusions that apply to both sexes, it would have been better to have an equal distribution of women and men in this study. For now, our results should be interpreted with more caution when applied to women with heart disease.\n",

      "value": "This study was a pilot study including 120 participants. Post hoc power analysis for the outcome measure of MVPA (primary outcome) revealed that our sample size was more than sufficient (100% power). Also, for the cardiovascular risk score, our sample size was sufficient. The number of participants would need to be (much) greater for detecting differences inmost of the secondary outcome measures. For example, based on obtained effect size, a sample size of 170 patients in total would have been needed to achieve 80% power at an alpha-error probability of .05 for the outcome measure of peak VO 2 . Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that a longer follow-up duration might have resulted in a larger difference between intervention and control group because regression to a more sedentary lifestyle might not show straightaway in cardiovascular risk factors and physical fitness. Therefore, a longer follow-up should be envisaged in future research with better power.\nBecause participants could only be enrolled in the study if they completed phase II CR, selection bias toward a highly motivated and physical active study group might have existed. The follow-up period of 6 months can be considered short as the aim of home-based CR is to induce changes in the remaining life of the participant.\nDespite extensive testing of the PATHway platform during development, technical errors occurred during the early part of the trial when a significant number of participants started using the PATHway platform at the same time. Complex technology should be stress-tested on a larger scale before implementation in atrial of this size. This seems to be of particular concern for systems that incorporate multiple components, hosted at different sites with use of the internet for communication.\nAs there are no adequately validated algorithms for the wrist-worn Actigraph GT9X Link, the choice to wear it at the nondominant wrist resulted in high absolute PA values and absolute values might thus not be accurate. However, since we opted fora 24 h/day protocol and the watch had also to be worn during the night, wearing the device at the wrist would most likely result in better wear-time compliance, which is why this device was chosen. As both PW and UC received the same wearing instructions and the same set-up protocol was applied at baseline and 6-month follow-up, we believe our results concerning detected differences in PA are reliable.\nWe observed a significant age difference between consenting and nonconsenting participants, suggesting that caution is warranted when extrapolating the results of acceptability and feasibility of a technological intervention to all CR participants.\n",
