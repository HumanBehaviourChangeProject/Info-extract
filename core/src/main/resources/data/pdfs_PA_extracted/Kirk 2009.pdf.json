Physical activity consultations increase physical activity in people with Type 2 diabetes but resources are often limited. Time2Act is a randomized control trial to study the 12-month effectiveness of a physical activity consultation delivered by a person or in written form, in contrast to standard care, for people with Type 2 diabetes.\nMethods A total of 134 inactive people with Type 2 diabetes in a contemplation or preparation stage were randomized to either intervention or standard care. Objective (accelerometer) and subjective (7-day recall) physical activity levels were measured over 1 week, along with physiological [blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference] and biochemical [glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ), total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol] measures at baseline, 6 and 12 months.\nResults Neither a physical activity consultation delivered by a person nor in written form was better than standard care at increasing physical activity levels or improving health outcomes in the full study cohort. Total and HDL cholesterol, waist circumference and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved over 12 months in all groups, whilst HbA 1c improved over 6 months. Ina subgroup (baseline pedometer steps < 5000 ⁄ day), the physical activity consultation delivered by a person significantly increased physical activity over 12 months and the standard care group significantly decreased.\nConclusions More research is needed which not only investigates the most economical and effective methods to promote physical activity, but also the best setting to conduct physical activity consultations and the participant factors affecting uptake of physical activity in Type 2 diabetes.",

      "value": "Physical activity is a cornerstone of Type 2 diabetes management which improves cardiovascular risk factors and reduces hyperglycaemia independent of change in body weight.\nPhysical activity as simple as walking can decrease mortality risk in people with Type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, people with Type 2 diabetes are substantially less likely to meet physical activity guidelines compared with the general population.\nIndividually adapted health behaviour change programmes that teach behavioural skills for self-management have been recommended because of their effectiveness in promoting physical activity. These behavioural approaches often use the transtheoretical model as a guide and include key elements such as goal setting, social support, problem solving and relapse prevention. They individually explore solutions rather than impose recommendations. In line with this approach, physical activity consultations have emerged as a successful strategy for the promotion of physical activity in people with Type 2 diabetes. Guidelines on conducting this intervention have been published for use in people with Type 2 diabetes. Brief advice approaches to physical activity promotion during routine practice use minimal resources but have not provided evidence of long-term effectiveness. Consultations have been successful but can be time intensive, lasting around 30 min, to include relevant behaviour change components. This requires greater resources such as time and money which limits widespread implementation into practice.\nFinding intervention strategies which are effective in promoting physical activity with minimal time involved for healthcare providers should be explored. Promising strategies have emerged using both web-based and print materials to increase physical activity levels and reduce glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) in people with Type 2 diabetes over 3 months, providing an indication that cost-effective strategies can be successful in the short term.\nTime2Act is a randomized control trial comparing the effectiveness of two methods of physical activity promotion for people with Type 2 diabetes, in contrast to standard care. Participants were randomized to receive a physical activity consultation delivered by a person or in written form to increase physical activity levels over 6 and 12 months. Secondary aims were to investigate the resultant effects on glycaemic control, lipid profile, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Change in medication was also monitored.\n",

      "value": "Neither a theory-driven physical activity consultation delivered by a person nor in written form were better than a standard care leaflet at increasing physical activity levels over 6 and 12 months in the full study group of people with Type 2 diabetes. These results were consistent across all measures of physical activity. As no increase in physical activity was evident, improvements in physiological and biochemical measures were not expected, although improvements in total and HDL cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and waist circumference were seen overtime in the full study sample over 12 months and in glycaemic control at 6 months. As many participants were newly diagnosed, it is likely they were able to achieve these improvements overtime with appropriate guidance, diet and medication following routine diabetes check-ups. Tighter cholesterol targets were also released for people with Type 2 diabetes during data collection. These factors made it more difficult to detect any change that may have occurred from our intervention.\nThe Time2Act was a well-designed study which included attributes known to be most effective in physical activity but it failed to show a significant increase in physical activity. In fact, a significant decrease was seen across all groups from 6 to 12 months. Dropout from the study was approximately 10% (in person delivered and standard care), with slightly higher rates (17%) in the written delivered group. The findings of this study are similar to results found in the ProActive UK trial. This larger trial promoted physical activity in adults at risk for Type 2 diabetes by comparing two theory-based interventions: a person-delivered and telephonedelivered intervention compared with a control group. They too found no improvements in physical activity levels or cardiorespiratory fitness over 12 months and suggested that more inclusive public health strategies are needed which take into account socio-cultural and environmental influences on physical activity.\nResults from Time2Act, however, are in contrast to other studies using a similar physical activity consultation method in people in Type 2 diabetes [3,9,10]. All three studies found an increase in physical activity and clinically meaningful improvements in HbA 1c . It is possible that our participants were healthier, indicative through physiological and biochemical parameters. In addition, they may have been more physically active to begin with. This is also likely, given average baseline levels of activity were over 6000 steps ⁄ day and 152 min of at least moderate activity which meets American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for health benefits of 150 min of moderate intensity activity ⁄ week. The group receiving a physical activity consultation delivered by a person was the most active at baseline with 6415 steps ⁄ day and 178 min of moderate activity ⁄ week. The success of the interventions maybe affected by baseline activity levels. Subgroup analysis of change in physical activity with Time2ACT participants who had a baseline step countless than 5000 steps ⁄ day identified significant interaction effects in total accelerometer counts and total pedometer counts, with pairwise comparisons revealing the physical activity consultation group delivered by a person to have significantly increased from baseline to 12 months and the standard care group to have significantly decreased from baseline to months and from 6 to 12 months. The physical activity consultation delivered in written form recorded no change. The goal of our interventions was to increase physical activity to meet ACSM health recommendations. This was possibly the wrong focus fora number of participants. Increasing the duration or intensity of activity to prevent weight gain and ⁄ or improve fitness would have been a more appropriate focus for these relatively active participants.\nRecruitment methods may have influenced the make-up of our relatively active study sample. This study relied heavily on media advertisements for volunteers rather than the sole recruitment through routine diabetes clinics. We found that using the media for volunteers attracted people who were more physically active or, conversely, just wanted to support a cause with no real interest in doing more physical activity. Future research should carefully consider the best method of recruitment.\nThere were notable changes between the current study and prior work of Kirk et al. in the delivery of the consultation. The current study used a structured format, with the workbook as a guide to ensure similar content between intervention groups. Prior research had no formalized workbook, only a discussion of cognitive behavioural strategies coupled with the transtheoretical model as an overarching guide. Perhaps visibly using a workbook created a less person-centered experience for the participant.\nThe location of consultation delivery in the study may have been a contributing factor as consultations were carried out at a university sports centre. Successful studies have delivered consultations in a medical setting, perhaps providing a feeling of legitimacy and medical endorsement with participants [3,. This is again supported by the ProActive UK trial which also found no change in physical activity levels after conducting a similar person-delivered intervention at participants' homes.\nIn summary, physical activity is a critical component of diabetes management which is underutilized at the individual level and under promoted in routine diabetes care. More research is needed not only to investigate the most economical and effective methods to promote physical activity, but also on the best setting to conduct physical activity consultations and the factors that may affect uptake of physical activity in diabetes care.\n",
