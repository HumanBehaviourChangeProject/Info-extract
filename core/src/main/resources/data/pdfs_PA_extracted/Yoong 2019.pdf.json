      "value": "Background: Given evidence suggesting that sleep impacts on metabolic processes, interventions targeting sleep may improve child physical activity (PA).\nObjectives: To describe the potential effect of an intervention to increase sleep on young children's (3-6 years) moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) and total PA. To determine adherence to the intervention, impact on sleep duration as well as feasibility, uptake and acceptability was also assessed.\nMethods: Pilot randomized controlled trial with 76 parent-child dyads randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 38) or control group (n = 38). Parents in the intervention group received a 3-month theory-informed intervention consisting of an online video, a telephone call and two text messages. Child PA was assessed using accelerometers at baseline and approximately 3 months. Parents also completed asleep log and a telephone interview.\nResults: The consent rate was 41% (76/186). Estimated effect size for the intervention relative to control was 10.8 min/day for MVPA, 2.7 min/day for PA and 0.9 h for sleep. Sixteen (44%) parents accessed the video, and 18 (50%) received the telephone call. Over 40% of parents found the video and telephone call useful/very useful.\nConclusions: This study reports promising effects that an intervention targeting sleep may improve child MVPA and sleep duration. Some modifications to data collection methods and intervention delivery are needed.",

      "value": "Inadequate physical activity (PA) is associated with the most prevalent causes of mortality and morbidity in Australia, including obesity. Childhood is a critical period to establish physically active behaviours (2), with PA levels in childhood reported to predict activity levels in later life. Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in particular is shown to prevent metabolic syndrome and obesity. International and population guidelines from various developed countries including Australia, USA and the UK recommend that young children spend at least 180 min in PA, of which 60 min is MVPA. Internationally, however, studies using objective measures of PA report that less than 10% meet these guidelines. Previous systematic reviews of interventions to improve PA in children aged 2 to 5 years however have reported only small to moderate effects on child PA (standardized mean difference: 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12-0.76). As such, strategies to enhance the efficacy of current PA interventions are needed.\nRecent reviews have outlined the importance of considering PA alongside other movement behaviours, such as sleep, in attempts to improve the health and PA of young children. A number of systematic reviews of mainly cross-sectional studies also report a possible association between sleep and obesityrelated risk factors including PA in young children. Randomized experimental designs however are needed to test whether a causal relationship exists between sleep and PA.\nTo our knowledge, only one experimental trial exists. This study used a randomized cross-over trial design where 37 school-aged children (8-11 years old) were allocated to increase or reduce sleep by 1.5 h per night for 1 week. The study found that children with shorter sleep duration had decreased mean PA levels and higher television viewing time, but no difference in MVPA relative to increased sleep duration. Limitations of the study include using self-reported measures of MVPA, and the prescription of asleep protocol which is unlikely to be sustained in the long term. Further studies assessing the potential relationship of targeting sleep on child PA are needed.\nTherefore, this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) seeks to describe the effect size of an intervention to support parents to modify household routines to increase child sleep duration on child MVPA and total PA. We also assessed the impact of the intervention on sleep, as well as report on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. We hypothesize that children receiving the sleep intervention will have higher levels of MVPA and total PA than children in the control arm.\n",

The intervention was based on best practice systematic review evidence and recommendations from peak sleep (i.e. American Academy of Sleep and Sleep Health Foundation) organizations. Intervention content was informed by the theory of planned behaviour and targeted parent's beliefs associated with their attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control related to sleep. The strategies included (i) having age appropriate bed-and day-time routines; (ii) removing distractions before bed; (iii) allowing child to self-sooth; and (iv) making concrete changes in household routines.\nSpecifically, between August and November 2016, parents received the following: a) Online video: Parents received a welcome email with a link to a pre-recorded video. The video was 12 min long and included a mix of visual and verbal instructions to enhance reflection on current beliefs and practices related to their child's sleep. The content targeted key behavioural, normative and control beliefs in relation to implementing recommended sleep practices. The video provided brief information about the benefits of sleep, the recommended amount of sleep for young children, discussed developmental changes in sleep patterns in young children (i.e. naps) and outlined key practical changes that could be implemented to promote healthy sleep. The video provided specific recommendations on how to implement routines conducive to sleep and provided concrete, practical tips for establishing pre and post bed-time routines. Lastly, the video outlined information for parents on how to incorporate these into their child's routines and how to deal with introducing such changes. Where participants had not accessed the video link within a week of it being sent, participants received one email reminder. b) Telephone call: Approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the video link was emailed, a trained psychologist from the parenting organization rang parents to provide support to implement the messages in the video. The psychologist briefly reiterated messages within the video and used motivational interviewing techniques to support parents to set specific goals for implementing new sleep routines and overcoming identified barriers. Where parents had not accessed the video link, the psychologist provided brief information regarding video content. Up to three attempts were made to reach parents, with up to another three follow-up calls for those parents making contact with the psychologist. c) Text messages: Two text messages were sent approximately 1 week after the phone call. Text messages were tailored to parent's engagement with the intervention and were aimed at encouraging parents to access the video and persist with implementing any new routines that had been put in place.\n",

Minutes of MVPA and total PA per day were determined using age-specific child-validated equations. Child total sleep duration per day was also assessed with a 7-day activity/sleep log.

      "value": "To our knowledge, this is the first RCT to assess the impact of targeting sleep promoting routines on objectively measured MVPA in 3 to 6 year olds. This pilot study found a small to moderate effect size favouring the intervention for all outcomes, on the basis of Cohen's effect sizes. In contrast, the only other randomized trial with 37 school-aged children found a reduction in child MVPA. Our study utilized an objective measure of MVPA whilst the other study relied on self-report of parents/educators. While the exact mechanisms are unknown, it is possible that increased sleep may impact on factors that influence energy metabolism or reduce fatigue and tiredness, subsequently increasing participation in MVPA.\nWhile the impact of the intervention on child activity and sleep appear promising, data regarding feasibility and acceptability suggests that some modifications to the data collection and intervention procedures maybe needed. Firstly, participant retention rate was variable, with between 34% and 74% completing each measure. The poor retention for some outcomes could be due to the burden of undertaking data collection for parents. Seven days of data collection was chosen to maximize the chance of obtaining three valid days of accelerometer data, as recommended for assessment of PA. It is possible that future data collection attempts could include a shorter period of data collection. Retention rates of approximately 50% however are common in trials to improve PA undertaken in young children. Other methods of collecting sleep data including the use of trackable devices or wrist  accelerometer may also reduce the burden of assessing sleep while increasing validity. Second, only 40% of intervention parents received both the telephone support and viewed the entire video. The current intervention modalities (online, text and telephone) were chosen as they provide wide reach. However, there were considerable challenges with delivering the components of the intervention. Sixteen (21%) parents were unable to be contacted, despite three call attempts and leaving messages. Further, only 15% found the text messages useful. It is possible that scheduling calls after hours or weekends could increase the number of individuals that received the telephone component. Further refinements to the content and modality of the intervention components as well as strategies to maximize uptake of the intervention are needed. This study had a number of limitations. Firstly, a self-reported measure of sleep duration was used, which may have overestimated the impact of the intervention on sleep. We did not use waist accelerometers to assess sleep due to human ethics concern of potential choking in younger children due to longer bands. Secondly, the trial was unable to recruit the planned number of participants (n = 150) due to lower than expected consent rate. Third, only 30% of parents received the full intervention dose despite numerous attempts to contact parents. Lastly, outcomes related to feasibility and acceptability were not included in the trial registration. Nevertheless, this trial provides promising pilot data to support the potential causal relationship sleep duration and MVPA in young children. Future trials using objective measures such as wrist or arm actigraphy, powered to detect significant differences in PA and sleep, which allow examination of the mediating effect of sleep on PA should be undertaken in order to advance efforts to improve PA in young children. Further, the integration of a nested, internal pilot in future definitive trials using similar intervention approaches should be considered given the recommended changes to data collection and intervention methods for this study.\n",
