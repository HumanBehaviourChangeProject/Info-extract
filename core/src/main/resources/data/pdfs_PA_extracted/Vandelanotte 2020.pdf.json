      "value": "Objectives Some online, personally tailored, text-based physical activity interventions have proven effective. However, people tend to 'skim' and 'scan' web-based text rather than thoroughly read their contents. In contrast, online videos are more engaging and popular. We examined whether web-based personally tailored physical activity videos were more effective in promoting physical activity than personally tailored text and generic information. Methods 501 adults were randomised into a videotailored intervention, text-tailored intervention or control. Over a 3-month period, intervention groups received access to eight sessions of web-based personally tailored physical activity advice. Only the delivery method differed between intervention groups: tailored video versus tailored text. The primary outcome was 7-day ActiGraph-GT3X+ measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) assessed at 0, 3 and 9 months. Secondary outcomes included self-reported MVPA and website engagement. Differences were examined using generalised linear mixed models with intention-to-treat and multiple imputation. Results Accelerometer-assessed MVPA increased 23% in the control (1.23 (1.06, 1.43)), 12% in the text-tailored (1.12 (0.95, 1.32)) and 28% in the video-tailored (1.28 (1.06, 1.53)) groups at the 3-month follow-up only, though there were no significant between-group differences. Both text-tailored (1.77 (1.37, 2.28]) and video-tailored (1.37 (1.04, 1.79)) groups significantly increased self-reported MVPA more than the control group at 3 months only, but there were no differences between video-tailored and texttailored groups. The video-tailored group spent significantly more time on the website compared with text-tailored participants (90 vs 77 min, p=0.02). Conclusions The personally tailored videos were not more effective than personally tailored text in increasing MVPA. The findings from this study conflict with pilot study outcomes and previous literature. Process evaluation and mediation analyses will provide further insights.

      "value": "To reduce chronic disease risk and improve mental health, it is recommended that adults engage in ≥150 min of moderate intensity physical activity per week. Unfortunately, physical inactivity is highly prevalent both globally and in Australia, where less than half of the population is meeting the National Physical Activity Guidelines. To reduce the burden of disease and healthcare costs, effective and affordable population-based interventions that can reach large numbers of people are needed. Given that about 90% of Australians have access to broadband internet-based, web-based interventions have potential to increase physical activity at a population level. Web-based interventions that provide 'tailored' or individually adapted physical activity advice have demonstrated good effectiveness compared with interventions offering generic or targeted information. Compared with generic messages, tailored messages are more likely to be read, remembered, saved and discussed with others. Content in webbased, computer-tailored interventions is typically delivered as text-based information. Yet eye-tracking studies demonstrate that internet-based reading is characterised by more time spent browsing, scanning, keyword spotting and non-linear reading, while less time is spent on in-depth concentrated reading. Consequently, text-based intervention content may not be read, processed and actioned as intended, limiting intervention effectiveness. This obstacle maybe overcome using tailored online videos, given that watching web-based video content is increasingly popular and may soon surpass television as most the popular channel for delivering video-based content. Videos may work better because they reduce the cognitive effort needed to process information, which can lead to better comprehension and are more engaging. Moreover, our pilot studies and other studies have demonstrated preliminary efficacy for using tailored videos to increase physical activity. However, methodological limitations of these studies (ie, self-report, short follow-up, small samples) require larger studies with longer follow-up periods to assess whether these findings can be replicated. Therefore, we conducted a three-arm randomised controlled trial named 'TaylorActive'. 'Taylor' refers to both the act of providing tailored information, but also to the name of the character who guided participants through the intervention; 'Active' refers to physical activity, hence the TaylorActive trial.

Briefly, the intervention aimed to increase all types of physical activity (eg, leisure, active travel, house/garden work, occupation). A library, available to all groups, contained 19 articles about different aspects of physical activity (eg, 'Why be active', 'Get started walking', 'Make time to be active'). The eight sessions of tailored physical activity content, available to both the text-tailored and video-tailored groups, was generated in response to brief online questionnaires about physical activity in conjunction with questions relating to evidence-based individual, social and environmental determinants of physical activity. IF-THEN algorithms were applied to select personally relevant advice from a comprehensive database. Health behaviour theories used to inform intervention content included self-determination theory, social cognitive theory and theory of planned behaviour. The following constructs were addressed throughout the sessions: self-efficacy, intentions, social support, knowledge, outcome expectancies, attitudes, facilitators and barriers and risk perception, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, need for relatedness, peripheral and central cues and habits. The following behavioural change techniques were applied to change theoretical constructs: feedback, self-monitoring, goal setting, habit formation, instruction, problem solving and action planning (see online supplemental file 2 for more detail). Physical activity advice and goals were tailored to participants' main motivation to increase activity levels: (1) improve health, (2) increase fitness, (3) increase strength, (4) lose weight and (5) reduce stress. The eight sessions with tailored feedback were delivered in a set order at a set time. New sessions could only be accessed when previous sessions had been completed; up to three email reminders were sent when participants did not access new sessions. A website feature to create action plans-a self-regulation strategy to develop detailed short-term activity plans-was also available for both intervention groups. At the end of each session (except the first and last session) participants were asked questions on how they would meet their activity goals (ie, what, where, when, how often, how long, with whom).\n",

To ensure that the ITT population was analysed, missing baseline data on the ActiGraph measures (n=38) were imputed using single group mean imputation (these data were missing due to a difference in how valid ActiGraph data were identified prior to randomisation and at the point of conducting analyses after the trial). Sensitivity analyses were conducted on all primary and secondary outcomes using multiple imputation (MI) on a missing at random assumption.

      "value": "This study examined the efficacy of a video-tailored physical activity intervention compared with a text-tailored intervention and a control group. No significant differences were observed between groups in the primary outcome of accelerometer measured MVPA at 3 or 9 months. Examination of secondary outcomes revealed some changes overtime and between groups, however, these were inconsistent. These findings were surprising given that computertailored physical activity interventions more broadly have demonstrated good effectiveness, and also given the positive outcomes of our formative research and pilot studies, which indicated participants' preference for and higher attention to personally tailored videos. Moreover, other studies have demonstrated support for the usability, feasibility and acceptability of using tailored videos over text-based interventions. To our knowledge, no other studies have specifically examined the use of tailored videos to increase physical activity; however, some studies have examined video tailoring in relation to smoking cessation, diet and obesity prevention. In these studies, the video-tailored intervention groups outperformed the other intervention groups. Interestingly, while Walthouwer et al concluded that their video-tailored intervention was effective overall for weight-gain prevention, the physical activity component within this broader intervention was ineffective, and thus inline with our study outcomes. A possible explanation for these findings is the use of a more rigorous study methodology including the use of accelerometers to measure physical activity instead of using surveys as in our pilot study. Many physical activity intervention studies have shown large discrepancies between survey and accelerometer measured physical activity outcomes. Similarly, in this study, self-reported physical activity outcomes demonstrated more favourable changes compared with the accelerometer measured outcomes. Self-report physical activity measures are known to over-report actual physical activity levels which may explain the observed discrepancies. Another explanation maybe that the tailored videos were not being perceived as sufficiently engaging. In our pilot study, tailored video content was developed for only two sessions using low-cost methods, including many images of people being active outdoors with a voice over. However, for this study, eight comprehensive sessions were developed including high-quality video production comprising of hundreds of video snippets. The greater number of videos required meant that videos did not show presenters engaging in activity, rather all videos were created in a studio with presenters reading from an autocue. This had the advantage of the content of the two interventions being very closely matched, thus allowing to isolate any differences inherent to the mode of delivery. However, this lack of diversity in the video library may have made the videos less interesting to watch. Additionally, it is harder to tailor videos than it is to tailor text. We used overlays to present information that could not be delivered by the actors featured in the videos, (eg, participant name, exact amount of MVPA), however, this may not have worked as well as anticipated. Finally, alack of change in targeted psychosocial correlates of physical activity (eg, self-efficacy, attitudes) due to ceiling effects, may also have prevented the interventions from being effective. Subsequent process evaluation and mediation/moderation analyses will provide further insights.\n",

      "value": "A strong decline in completing sessions was observed for both intervention groups, with slightly fewer participants in the video-tailored group completing all sessions. This finding is comparable to other studies that reported sharp declines in intervention usage. Interestingly, Walthouwer et al reported similar outcomes to our study in terms of session completion: fewer participants in the video group completing all sessions (11% completed all sessions in their study, compared with 35% in this study). It maybe that watching videos is perceived as more burdensome, as the pace of gathering new information is dictated by the pace of the video; unlike in the text-tailored group, where one could read and skip/scan at one's own pace. This may also explain why the video-tailored group spent more time online (this was also observed in our pilot study), but without a meaningful effect on MVPA. In previous studies, time spent using the intervention has been associated with the effectiveness of the intervention). However, our study indicates that simple engagement measures, such as time spent online, may not be meaningful enough when using tailored videos, as it was only marginally related to change in physical activity. Speaking more broadly, about why neither text-tailored or video-tailored interventions were effective: it maybe that the overall architecture of the website (a 'tunnel' with periodically released sessions) was ineffective, though little research has been conducted on optimising website structure, and outcomes have been inconclusive. Furthermore, the tailored websites had very few features beyond the actual tailoring of information (eg, no social networking or gamification), and perhaps a larger number of features is needed to achieve more meaningful behaviour change. Subsequent in-depth analyses of user engagement will provide further insights.\n",

      "value": "Major strengths of the trial were the use of validated and objectively measured outcomes, the longer than usually reported follow-up period (9 months), the large sample for this type of study, nationwide participant recruitment, the randomised controlled design and the strict protocol in isolating the intervention delivery mode, while keeping all other variables similar across intervention groups. A notable limitation of this study was the high drop-out and associated missing data (49% at months, 67% at 9 months). This may have had an impact on the results if the data were not missing at random. The sensitivity analysis, using MI (including additional sociodemographic covariates to reduce impact of any systematic differences between groups), was largely consistent with the main results, despite some small differences which maybe attributable to lack of statistical power and/or differential drop-out. There maybe several reasons for the large participant drop-out. First, high drop-out is typical of web-based behavioural studies, with many other studies reporting similar levels of drop-out. Sometimes this occurs due to technical issues (eg, website down, tailored feedback is not being delivered, web-based videos are not playing, reminder e-mails not being sent), however, no such issues were observed by the research team or reported by participants during the trial. As such technical issues were unlikely to be responsible for the high drop-out. Second, there was no face-to-face contact between participants and the research team at any point, and this may have reduced feelings of accountability as we have observed in other trials. Third, participant burden may have been too high, with study protocols requiring lengthy telephone-administered questionnaires at each time point. Other studies have demonstrated associations between participant retention and survey length. A further limitation could be the lack of a true (ie, no treatment) control group, as physical activity increases were observed in the control group. While increases in information-only control groups has previously been reported, generic physical activity information is freely available on the Internet and forms a strong basis to compare whether more comprehensive, complex and costly interventions are more effective. A final limitation was the high proportion of Caucasian, highly educated and female participants. Future studies should aim to include more diverse populations.\n",

Further, if this field of research is to truly progress, it remains important to examine the effectiveness of specific intervention components in isolation, in contrast to examining a plethora of components simultaneously that make it impossible to attribute outcomes to specific components.
