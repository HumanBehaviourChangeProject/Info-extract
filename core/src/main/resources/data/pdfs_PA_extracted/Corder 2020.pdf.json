The determinants of physical activity in adolescents are multilevel and poorly understood, but the school's social environment likely plays an important role. We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a school-based programme (GoActive) to increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among adolescents.\nNon-fee-paying, co-educational schools including Year 9 students in the UK counties of Cambridgeshire and Essex were eligible for inclusion. Within participating schools (n = 16), all Year 9 students were eligible and invited to participate. Participants were 2,862 13-to 14year-olds (84% of eligible students). After baseline assessment, schools were computerrandomised, stratified by school-level pupil premium funding (below/above county-specific median) and county (control: 8 schools, 1,319 participants, mean [SD] participants per school n = 165 [62]; intervention: 8 schools, 1, 543 participants, n = 193 [43]).

      "value": "Physical inactivity is the fourth largest cause of death worldwide and is thought to be the principal cause of 1 in 3 cases of heart disease. In adolescence, physical activity levels are low. Recent data show that less than 20% of adolescents meet the WHO physical activity guidelines of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) everyday, with little changeover time. Not only is inactivity increasingly linked to poor health in childhood, it may have long-lasting negative implications for health and educational achievement in adulthood. Compared to their inactive peers, active adolescents are more likely to become active and healthy adults, and as such, preventing a decline in activity during adolescence is a major public health priority. The challenge for public health professionals is to identify effective and cost-effective strategies to achieve this.\nEvidence suggests that the reduction in physical activity in adolescence predominantly occurs outside of school. School settings offer away of reaching large numbers of young people from abroad range of backgrounds, and it therefore remains pragmatic and attractive to utilise the school setting for recruitment and delivery of physical activity promotion targeting the whole week. Despite this, physical activity promotion research in adolescent populations is scarce and challenging, with review-level evidence showing no effect on devicemeasured physical activity and few studies in children over 12 years of age. This lack of effect is hypothesised to be due to low intervention fidelity and poor implementation. Studies of the cost-effectiveness of school-based physical activity promotion report mixed results (e.g.,). As school funders are faced with finite resources, there is a continued need for the identification of effective and affordable school-based activity promotion strategies among older adolescents to inform the best use of limited funds.\nBest practice guidelines suggest intervention development should be based on behaviour change theory, existing evidence, and pre-trial qualitative work with the target group. Following our review of existing school-based strategies and novel analyses of existing data, we identified limitations of previous adolescent physical activity promotion strategies including alack of whole-population approaches, limited adolescent involvement in intervention development, poor participant engagement, and lack of consideration of potential negative impacts. We have previously reported on the development and pilot work of the GoActive (Get Others Active) intervention, in which we aimed to address these limitations. GoActive employs a population approach, in that it targets a whole year group irrespective of personal characteristics, to overcome the potential stigma of solely targeting at-risk\n",

It should be noted, however, that the utility and effectiveness of these frameworks has yet to be established comprehensively. A common feature of these frameworks is the importance of senior leadership buy-in. The GoActive intervention was not initiated by senior leaders, and inmost cases their involvement was only for consent sign-off. This may indicate limited buy-in, which may have affected GoActive's potential for effect.\nEach school is a unique system with its own culture, and during this research the team experienced barriers to intervention implementation that varied on a school level due to what we often perceived as differences in school culture, ethos, or attitudes. This led us to consider that a randomised controlled trial expecting the same intervention to be replicable, let alone effective, across multiple schools maybe an unrealistic expectation and that perhaps aiming for success at a school-by-school level maybe more realistic. Although schools are unique microenvironments, standardisation in approaches to every aspect of the curriculum is increasingly becoming normal practice, and appears welcome in schools. There is a need to pursue real and interdisciplinary understanding and collaboration that is likely to deviate from the path of subject-specific research agendas. This should lead to a deeper understanding of the educational system and culture, and may require a shift in the field's ideological principles on physical activity interventions and their delivery in the educational system. Interdisciplinary techniques and disciplines such as ethnography, education, anthropology, sociology, and social networks could progress further understanding of the cultural context of physical activity behaviour in the educational setting.\n",

Mentorship and peer-leadership addressed time pressures, which were stated by teachers in our development work as being a barrier to participation in activity promotion programmes, and between-class competition was incorporated as a strategy to encourage teacher enthusiasm.\nThe mapping of intervention components to published behaviour change techniques has been published in previous GoActive papers, and an overview of key intervention elements and delivery structure is available in S1 Text and S1 Fig., each Year 9 tutor group (class or homeroom) chose 2 activities each week from a selection provided. GoActive targeted peer-led class-based activity, with participation also encouraged outside of school. Working with existing class tutors (members of teaching staff), older adolescent mentors encouraged Year 9 students to try at least 1 weekly GoActive session. Activity points were gained for PLOS MEDICINE activity participation in and outside of school irrespective of duration or intensity; students were encouraged to regularly log 'activity points' on the GoActive website to unlock rewards. The GoActive intervention was delivered over 12 weeks. During the first 6 weeks, delivery was facilitated by intervention facilitators (health trainers employed by local councils), who provided school staff and older adolescent mentors with training, support, and resources for intervention delivery. Facilitator support for the programme was reduced during the second 6 weeks to encourage school-led sustainability.\nIrrespective of whether students participated in measurements, intervention delivery was at a school tutor group level to all eligible students in intervention schools; parents were encouraged to speak with the school if they wanted to opt their child out of the intervention participation, but no parents chose this option.

We measured MVPA at baseline, post-intervention, and 10-month follow-up using wrist-worn activity monitors (Axivity) assessing acceleration (continuous waveform data). Participants were asked to wear the monitors for 7 days continuously, for 24 hours a day, on their non-dominant wrist. These monitors have been validated to assess physical activity energy expenditure and have better wear time adherence and acceptability than commonly used hip-worn monitors among adolescents. Given the 24-hour wear time protocol of the Axivity monitors, a diurnal adjustment was used to reduce any bias caused by imbalances of protocol deviations regarding non-wear. Each day of possible wear was divided into 4 time quadrants: morning (6 AM-12 PM), afternoon (12 PM-6 PM), evening (6 PM-midnight), and night (midnight-6 AM). For participants to be included in analyses, over 6 hours of wear time spread over at least 2 days was required from the possible 42 hours in each daytime quadrant (i.e., 6 hours from 7 possible mornings, 6 hours from 7 possible afternoons, and 6 hours from 7 possible evenings). The 'night' quadrant (i.e., midnight-6 AM) was considered as sleep time and was included in the denominator when calculating daily averages of MVPA, for consistency across all participants. Where individuals did not wear the monitor for 6 hours at nighttime, despite the protocol requesting them to wear it continuously for 7 days, average nighttime values were imputed using population averages (n = 91 at baseline and n = 463 at follow-up), created from GoActive participants with 100% protocol compliance regarding monitor wear, to avoid inflation of MVPA estimates. This method was verified by running simulations excluding night data fora subsample of participants with 100% protocol compliance. For an individual hour to be included for analysis, at least 70% of possible wear time was required, with non-worn time within the hour considered as missing.\nMonitor output was processed to provide minutes spent in MVPA equivalent to 2,000 ActiGraph counts per minute (cpm). Additional secondary accelerometry-derived outcomes were average daily minutes of sedentary time (equivalent to 100 ActiGraph cpm), average daily minutes of light physical activity (equivalent to 101-1,999 ActiGraph cpm), and average daily activity (represented by average acceleration). In addition to daily averages, all intensity outcomes (including MVPA) were also derived during school time (9 AM-3 PM), during weekday after school time (after 3 PM), and at weekends. Participants who met the inclusion criteria for average daily MVPA were included in any analyses for which they had sufficient data ( 2 days). As the criteria for deriving average daily MVPA did not require both weekend and weekdays of valid data, participant numbers varied by outcome.\n",

There were inconclusive indications of a more negative effect among boys and a more favourable effect for adolescents with low and medium socioeconomic status. Secondary physical activity outcomes showed differential impact across weekdays and weekends, with small between-group differences favouring the control group on weekdays for light physical activity and sedentary time. The findings also indicate that the GoActive intervention is not cost-effective, and that intervention implementation was variable. There was no evidence that the intervention negatively impacted well-being.\nOur findings are inline with results from recent reviews suggesting limited effectiveness of research-driven physical activity promotion interventions on whole-day MVPA. The absence of intervention effect on time spent in MVPA could be partly due to inadequate implementation; the per-protocol population was small, and our initial process evaluation findings indicate that some intervention components, such as mentorship, were not adequately implemented. However, the per-protocol analysis produced similar results to the main analyses, indicating that if the intervention had been implemented with higher fidelity, it may still not have been effective at a whole-population level. The per-protocol definition focused on website use and reported activity sessions. Use of the website was low and contrasts with the high engagement observed in the pilot trial, which indicated preliminary effectiveness. This pattern is common in behavioural interventions, with 75% lower effectiveness seen for behavioural interventions across various health behaviours at the full trial stage compared to feasibility and pilot testing. This is thought to beat least partly due to adaptations needed to implement programmes at scale. Since its inception, GoActive has been designed to be scalable by including a website and flexibility for use in multiple school structures. However, implementation difficulties may have arisen from the provision of implementation flexibility for schools-an issue also identified in the Girls Active study-as well as alack of clarity in the conceptualisation of the mentor and teacher roles. Additionally, the delivery agent of the intervention changed between the pilot (research staff) and full trial (local-authority-funded health trainer, supported by the research team), which may have contributed to the reduced effectiveness. This points to the challenge for researchers to design interventions that are scalable at the outset, which would minimise the need for major adaptions.\nIt has been suggested that fora school-based intervention to work, it needs to include a mechanism from at least 1 category outlined in the Theory of Expanded, Extended, and Enhanced Opportunities; the GoActive intervention targeted 2 of these. The 'expansion' mechanism suggests providing new occasions to be active by replacing sedentary time with physical activity, such as adding activity to previously sedentary tutor times. Another suggested mechanism implemented in GoActive is 'extension', which suggests lengthening the time\n",

Our results from this rigorous and honest evaluation maybe uncomfortable, but they highlight the importance of thorough testing of outcomes and unexpected negative consequences and could serve as a warning to those wishing to implement interventions without a candid evaluation. Current research-led approaches to school physical activity promotion do not appear to be effective in their current forms and are unlikely to lead to populationlevel changes in adolescents' behaviour. The GoActive intervention was rigorously designed with students and teachers and iteratively tested and refined, but despite this rigorous and costly process, when implemented at scale it was no better than the normal school curriculum at preventing declines in adolescent physical activity. We recommend that authorities are cautious about commissioning and rolling out school-based health promotion strategies, that potential unintended negative consequences are considered, and that they are realistic about the scale of behaviour change that can be achieved at a population level and the challenges of implementing a programme as intended.\n",

Together with other recent evidence, this suggests that current research-driven approaches to school-based adolescent physical activity promotion are not effective, with implementation challenges likely playing an important role in the lack of effect. Interdisciplinary research should seek to further understanding of the cultural context of physical activity behaviour in the educational setting. Funders, researchers, and local authorities should be realistic about expectations of the effect of school-based adolescent physical activity promotion strategies implemented at scale.\n",
