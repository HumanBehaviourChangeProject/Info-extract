      "value": "In dyadic planning a target person and a planning partner create plans for when, where, and how the target person will change a health-relevant behavior. Across 52 weeks, direct and indirect effects of a dyadicplanning intervention on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and physical fitness in target persons and their partners were investigated in a randomized controlled trial. Relationship quality was explored as a moderator. Methods: N = 338 couples (target persons randomized) were randomly assigned to a dyadic-planning-(DPC), an individual-planning-(IPC), or a no-planning dyadic-control condition (CC). MVPA was objectively assessed four times across 52 weeks using accelerometry. Physical fitness and proposed mediators (individual action control, received behavior-specific support and control) were repeatedly assessed. Relationship quality was measured at baseline. Latent growth curve-, multi-level-, and manifest mediation models were fit. Results: Across 52 weeks, MVPA of IPC and CC target persons increased. MVPA of DPC target persons remained stable, but those who reported high relationship quality increased their MVPA overtime. DPC partners showed steeper increases in physical fitness when compared to IPC partners, but not CC partners. DPC partners' increases in physical fitness were mediated by received support from target persons.\nThe dyadic planning intervention showed non-beneficial effects for target persons' MVPA, but beneficial effects on their partners' fitness. These findings resemble evidence from the social support literature indicating more benefits for support providers than for recipients.

      "value": "Promoting physical activity and physical fitness are central primary prevention strategies aiming to reduce risk for noncommunicable diseases. For health benefits in adults, international guidelines recommend a minimum of 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) throughout the week which refers to any activity with â‰¥3 metabolic equivalents of task. The majority of adults worldwide do not adhere to these guidelines. To help people translate their good intentions into action and maintain their actions overtime, individual action planning and social support) maybe incorporated as active components of interventions targeting adults' physical activity. Dyadic action planning, that is two persons (a target person and a planning partner) jointly planning a behavior to be carried out by one of them (the target person), combines shares of both proposed active ingredients in one dyadic action regulation strategy. Recently, reported short-term effects of a dyadic planning intervention on target persons' and partners' everyday physical activity by examining data of the present couple randomized controlled trial (RCT) up to the 6-week follow-up (i.e., primary outcome time-frame). Whereas short-term analyses by were focusing on adoption and short-term maintenance of physical activity, long-term analyses performed in the present study (i.e., up to the 52-weeks follow-up) would clarify the sustainability of intervention effects in terms of long-term physical activity maintenance. Besides physical activity, physical fitness is another health-relevant outcome of physical activity-related interventions, which was not included in the study on short-term findings due to its slow-changing nature as a physiological measure. However, in the present study, changes of physical fitness would be expected to be observable at a long-term followup (i.e., 52 weeks). To summarize, in addition to target persons' and partners' objectively assessed MVPA, the present study investigates target persons' and partners' physical fitness. Furthermore, the role of proposed intervention mediators (i.e., action control, social support, and social control) are investigated and relationship quality is explored as a potential moderator.\nIndividual planning (also referred to as implementation intentions; was shown to help bridging the intention-behavior gap regarding physical activity. It is defined as the prospective mental simulation of future situational cues (e.g., when, where) that are linked to a behavioral response (cf.. In addition to individual planning, two dyadic forms of planning have been proposed. Collaborative planning (e.g., describes a process where both dyad members jointly form plans for their (predominantly) joint behavioral enactment. Dyadic planning, on the other hand, refers to jointly forming plans for the behavioral enactment of one dyad member, the target person, while the other person, the partner, provides planning assistance. Extending the above reviewed rationale for the examination of long-term effects of dyadic planning, it maybe assumed that the planning partner may act as a reminder and resource to fallback on when the target person's self-regulation becomes more difficult. To this end, findings from a correlative longitudinal study with men after prostate cancer surgery suggested that associations of self-reported dyadic planning with patients' rehabilitative training tended to manifest later in the behavior change process.\nDyadic planning is also assumed to aid health behavior change by enhancing post-intentional individual and dyadic behavior-regulatory strategies that are often placed in the post-intentional or volitional behavior change process in cognitive behavior change models. These strategies include individual action control as well as received behavior-specific support and control from the dyadic planning partner. Individual action control reflects awareness of standards, self-monitoring, and regulation efforts to achieve behavioral goals. Used as an in-situ strategy to monitor and reduce discrepancies between intended and currently implemented behavior change, action control was shown to be positively related to the adoption and maintenance of physical activity (e.g.,. Additionally, the partner's inclusion in the planning process is assumed to instigate behavior-specific social support that refers to the planning partner's provision of instrumental assistance in and emotional encouragement for behavior change. Social support provision is associated with better physical activity outcomes (e.g.,. Another social exchange process assumed to mediate effects of dyadic planning on physical activity is social control from the partner. As a result of their involvement in the dyadic planning process, partners may try to actively influence target persons by pressuring or reminding them to perform the behavior. Social control encompasses positive and negative forms of interaction and can be a mixed blessing when it comes to health behavior change (e.g.,. Earlier work by investigating couples with prostate cancer patients striving to regularly perform rehabilitation exercises showed differential behavioral effects of social control after an individual versus a dyadic planning intervention.\nIn addition to bridging the target person's intention-behavior gap, dyadic planning may aid the planning partner's behavior change. For instance, behavioral transmission in dyads, specifically couples, is well documented and might propel dyadic planning partners to become more active. Furthermore, within-dyad reciprocity of social exchange processes, including dyadic planning and social support, may produce beneficial effects on planning partners' behavior.\nTo date, evidence from RCTs on dyadic planning's effectiveness is limited. Only one study, presenting short-term findings of the present RCT, investigated everyday physical activity as the outcome. This study showed no differential increase in accelerometer-assessed physical activity in target persons of a dyadic planning condition, compared with target persons from an individual planning condition or a dyadic no-planning control condition (see supplementary material A for the study material). Exploratory moderator analyses indicated that target persons from the dyadic planning condition who reported low relationship quality showed a decrease in physical activity over 6 weeks after the intervention, whereas physical activity was stable among target persons reporting high relationship quality. Partners from the dyadic planning condition showed an initial increase in vigorous activity up to the 1-week follow-up, and a decrease during the following 5 weeks. In target persons from the dyadic planning condition, proposed mediators, individual action control and received partner support, but not received partner control, increased as a result of the dyadic planning intervention. The same was true for dyadic planning partners' received support. However, for target persons and partners alike, proposed mediators of dyadic planning were largely unrelated to physical activity outcomes at the 6-week follow-up.\n",

Moreover, accelerometer-assessed MVPA, the primary outcome, was complemented by an objectively measured physical health indicator, physical fitness.\nRegarding changes in accelerometer-assessed MVPA (Hypothesis 1a) and physical fitness (Hypothesis 1b) over the course of 52 weeks, highest increases were expected for target persons who took part in a dyadic planning condition (DPC) compared to target persons from an individual planning condition (IPC) or a no-planning dyadic control condition (CC). Furthermore, highest increases in MVPA (Hypothesis 2a) and physical fitness (Hypothesis 2b) over 12 months were expected for partners of the DPC when compared to IPC and CC partners. Dyadic planning intervention effects on target persons' MVPA (Hypothesis 3a) and physical fitness (Hypothesis 3b) as well as partners' MVPA (Hypothesis 4a) and physical fitness (Hypothesis 4b) were assumed to be mediated by individual action control, received physical activityspecific support, and received physical activity-specific control from the other partner.

At T0, T2, T3, and T7, participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer on their right hip during waking hours for 7 consecutive days. Valid wear times were assessment periods in which the accelerometer was worn on at least 4 days for at least 10 h per day (i.e., valid wear day). Using the algorithm by for each valid wear day, daily minutes of MVPA were computed with a sum score of minutes with at least 6167 counts per minute (i.e., at least moderate intensity of movement). Univariate outliers (z > |3.29|) were winsorized to 1 unit lower/higher than the next highest/lowest value in the distribution.\nPhysical fitness. At T0 and T7, participants' physical fitness was assessed with a 2 km walking test. Couples were asked to walk as fast as possible (but not run or jog), without risking their health. An indoor flat venue was used for the test. Based on participants' age, sex, body mass index (BMI), test duration, and heart-rate after finishing the 2 km distance, a physical fitness parameter was computed.

Randomization checks were conducted applying multivariate analyses of variance with Bonferroni post-hoc tests and logistic regressions. Manipulation checks were performed using multiple regression models with self-reported dyadic planning as the outcome.\nTo investigate long-term intervention effects on MVPA and physical fitness, latent growth curve models (LGCM; for continuous outcomes were fit with Mplus. Manifest indicators of intercept and slope were MVPA levels at T0, T2, T3, and T7 for MVPA models or physical fitness at T0 and T7 for fitness models. To examine between-group differences, conditions were dummy coded and DPC was used as a reference. IPC and CC (vs. DPC as reference) were modelled as predictors of the intercept and linear slope. The intercept was modelled at T7 to directly determine between-group differences at the 52-week follow-up. The linear slope reflected the weekly time trend between week 1 and week 52 following the lab-based intervention at T1. Unless dichotomous, covariates were grand-mean centered. Covariates were modelled as time-invariant (i.e., T0 covariates) predictors of the interceptor time-variant (i.e., accelerometer wear time in MVPA models) predictors of the indicators. Controlling for covariates, unstandardized intercept coefficients represented mean differences between conditions at T7 and unstandardized slope coefficients represented mean group differences in change in MVPA or physical fitness.\nMediation hypotheses were tested using manifest mediation models in Mplus predicting T7 MVPA or T7 physical fitness as the outcome and using individual action control, received partner support, and partner control as mediators between dummy-coded group variables and the outcome (effects of the mediators at different measurement points were tested: T2, T3, T4, and T6; see supplementary materials B, Table). Baseline levels of the outcome and the mediators and covariates were accounted for in all mediation models. Bias-corrected bootstrapping (BC) with 5000 resamples was applied and indirect effects for the 97.5% confidence interval (CI BC ) were calculated.\nConcerning the moderator and simple slope analyses with baseline relationship quality, LGCMs yielded a negative variance covariance matrix. Instead of LGCM, we conducted analogous linear mixed models in SPSS (measurement points in time nested within individuals) with a linear time trend centered at T7. Relationship quality, all 2-and 3-way interaction terms with the linear time trend, dummy-coded conditions IPC and CC (vs. DPC as reference), and covariates were included as predictors of MVPA or physical fitness.

When evidence of a time x relationship quality interaction emerged in analyses within the DPC, this was followed up by simple slope analyses.

Experimental conditions consisted of the lab-based intervention session and a home-based booster session, conducted 20 weeks following the intervention in the lab. Whereas the lab-based intervention session had passed manipulation checks, the booster did not result in a further increase of couples' selfreported dyadic planning.\nPrior findings from this RCT showed no between-condition differences in terms of changes in target persons' physical activity up to the primary endpoint at 6 weeks following the lab-based intervention session. At the 52-weeks follow-up, while the DCP had no effect on target persons' MVPA, target persons from IPC and CC managed to increase their MVPA overtime. Contrary to our hypotheses, participating in the DPC seemed to impede an otherwise general increase in MVPA in target persons, motivated to become more physically active. Moreover, partners from all conditions, including DPC partnersnone of whom were directly targeted by active intervention procedures -increased their MVPA across 52 weeks. These findings show that the dyadic planning intervention resulted in distinct effects on target persons and their partners. In terms of general MVPA improvements of the IPC and CC, similar results were found by who also examined long-term effects on objective physical activity. Regarding weight loss as the outcome, the study by also reports long-term improvements of both an individual planning intervention condition and the active control condition.

In the short run, dyadic planning was positively and mostly differentially (i.e., between-condition differences) associated with other potentially helpful intervention mechanisms, including action control and behavior-specific support in target persons. However, neither of the proposed mediators, including social control that was unaffected by the intervention, were related with MVPA at the 52-week followup. Furthermore, a similar picture emerged in target persons' short-term mediation models, using physical activity outcomes at the 6-week follow-up. We believe that although they were unrelated to any of the DPC target persons' outcomes, insights may nevertheless come from these mediators themselves; particularly, from a relatively strong differential increase of action control in DPC target persons (at T2) following the lab-based intervention session. The set-up of the DPC casted partners in the role of \"supportive spectators\" to the behavior change process, likely increasing target persons' need to very closely monitor their successive attempts to become more active. This might have -inadvertently -put target persons on the spot for success to a degree that was non-productive for many, specifically for those who had reported poorer relationship quality (discussed below). An earlier RCT examining couples) also led to differential increases inaction control in tumor patients following a dyadic planning intervention to increase rehabilitative exercises, albeit there, the increase of action control appeared to be beneficial. Nevertheless, the present increase inaction control may predominantly indicate an increase in self-focused attention, and in this case likely public self-focus. Public self-focus is defined as reflections on one's own goals and behaviors \"in which the needs, desires, or reactions of others are acknowledged and taken into account\". For target persons of the DPC, the public self-focus may have compromised an otherwise high motivation to become more active, for instance, via increases of negative affect. Likewise, further support from the dyadic planning partner might have created additional costs to DPC target-persons' self-esteem (e.g.,. Future work should account for additional mechanisms, such as public self-focus or self-esteem, to better account for the potential costs of dyadic planning.\nSimilar to short-term findings of this RCT, relationship quality moderated intervention effects on MVPA in DPC target persons, but not in DCP partners. DPC target persons who had reported high relationship quality increased their MVPA over 52 weeks, but those with lower relationship quality did not. This suggests that relationship quality enhanced the otherwise non-beneficial long-term effects of the DPC on MVPA, possibly via buffering the impact of the inadvertently placed spectator effect. The consistently observed moderation of relationship quality underscores recommendations from the couple intervention literature to routinely take into account couples' relationship functioning.\nFindings regarding physical fitness as a long-term outcome yielded partial support for hypotheses concerning partners, but not for target persons. This pattern of results is similar to short-term findings, where DPC partners, but not DCP target persons emerged with direct beneficial, albeit small and short-lived effects of the intervention on vigorous activity. In the present study, DPC and CC partners showed similar increases in physical fitness that were larger than those of ICP partners. Additionally, only among DPC partners, this direct effect was mediated via early (i.e., 1 week following the labbased intervention) reports of support received from target persons. DPC partners' plan assistance during and shortly after the lab-based main intervention was likely reciprocated by target persons inform of enhanced dyadic planning of partners' physical activity and enhanced supportive interaction, benefiting partners. These early dynamics may have presented a means to prolong indirect beneficial effects for DPC partners, who were lesson the spot for success than target persons and might thus have derived a net benefit from social exchange processes instigated by the DPC, if not in terms of their MVPA, then at least in terms of their physical fitness.\nConsidering the sum of apparent, albeit small, short-term and longterm benefits of the DPC for partners, their randomly assigned role of plan-related support provider in the DPC might have put them in a less compromising position than target persons who were assigned the role of plan-related support recipients and put on the spot for success. In all, these findings resemble evidence on positive effects of support provision not only on providers' own well-being, but also on their health behavior.\n",

      "value": "Despite strengths of the study including the assessment of both partners' perspectives, the objective measurement of study outcomes as well as the controlled testing of intervention components, some limitations have to be considered and amended by future research. First, participants were relatively active from the start. For individuals with higher baseline physical activity (vs. those with lower), planning intervention effects are often not superior to control condition effects (e.g.,. Future studies should attempt to recruit individuals who are particularly in need to increase their physical activity. Second, the present couple study focused on primary prevention, namely physical activity promotion in a healthy population. In dyadic planning, two dyad members are assigned to distinct roles, thus, interventions might be more effective in couple contexts in which partners naturally act in distinct roles, with one partner potentially more in need for behavior change than the other (e.g., patient-caregiver contexts;. Third and relatedly, this trial featured a highly controlled study design, with participants randomly assigned to only one study role (i.e., target person as the recipient and partner as the provider). Randomly assigned roles might have counteracted some couples' preferred behavior-specific support dynamics and inadvertenly contributed to the set of non-findings for DPC target persons. In future research on dyadic planning study roles might be switched after the initial round of planning which would enhance partners' equity and provide both partners with the (assigned) opportunity to act as providers. Fourth, to learn more about mechanisms of dyadic planning interventions, open-ended qualitative questions should be added, for instance to ask for information on the exact nature of action control and supportive interactions in couples. Fifth, the time gaps between the lab-based intervention and the booster (i.e., 20 weeks after the lab-based intervention) as well as between the booster and the last measurement point (i.e., 32 weeks for the behavioral outcome) were long which could limit the additive effect of the booster. Multiple booster sessions might be conducted (cf. following the first intervention to integrate initial plan attainment experiences into plan adjustments.\nTo conclude, the dyadic planning intervention yielded no overall improvements for target persons' long-term MVPA and physical fitness. Improvements regarding physical fitness were found for dyadic planning partners who provided (plan-related) support in the intervention sessions. Beneficial effects of support provision and its implications for dyadic planning interventions should be followed up in future research.\n",
