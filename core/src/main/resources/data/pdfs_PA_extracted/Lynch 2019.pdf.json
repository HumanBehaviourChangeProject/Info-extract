      "value": "The benefits of an active lifestyle after abreast cancer diagnosis are well recognized, but the majority of survivors are insufficiently active. The ACTIVATE Trial examined the efficacy of an intervention (use of the Garmin Vivofit 2 activity monitor coupled with a behavioral feedback and goal-setting session and 5 telephone-delivered health coaching sessions) to increase moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and reduce sedentary behavior in breast cancer survivors. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial recruited 83 inactive, postmenopausal women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer who had completed primary treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group or to the control group, and the intervention was delivered over a 12-week period. MVPA and sedentary behavior were measured with Actigraph and activPAL accelerometers at baseline (T1) and at the end of the intervention (T2). RESULTS: Retention in the trial was high, with 80 (96%) of participants completing T2 data collection. At T2, there was a significant between-group difference in MVPA (69 min/wk; 95% CI = 22-116) favoring the intervention group. The trial resulted in a statistically significant decrease in both total sitting time and prolonged bouts (≥20 min) of sitting, with between-group reductions of 37 min/d (95% CI = −72 to −2) and 42 min/d (95% CI = −83 to −2), respectively, favoring the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Results from the ACTIVATE Trial suggest that the use of wearable technology presents an inexpensive and scalable opportunity to facilitate more active lifestyles for cancer survivors. Whether or not such wearable technology-based interventions can create sustainable behavioral change should be the subject of future research.",

      "value": "For breast cancer survivors, regular participation in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is associated with prolonged survival, diminished treatment side effects, and enhanced quality of life. Despite these benefits, many breast cancer survivors do not achieve physical activity recommendations (ie, 150 minutes of MVPA per week). Less is known about the health effects of sedentary behavior (defined as any waking behavior that expends ≤1.5 metabolic equivalents while sitting, reclining, or lying down). However, preliminary evidence from studies of breast cancer survivors suggests too much sitting maybe adversely associated with adiposity, quality of life, and fatigue. Supervised exercise interventions delivered to breast cancer survivors, as either individual or group sessions, typically result in significant improvements in MVPA, as well as a number of physiological adaptations including improved Cancer August 15, 2019 body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, and physical function. However, access to such interventions maybe limited by cost, geographic reach, and availability of facilities and appropriately qualified health professionals. Even when supervised, structured exercise programs are offered to cancer survivors at no cost, uptake and adherence maybe low. To achieve higher rates of physical activity participation by breast cancer survivors, a variety of interventions need to be developed, tested, and translated into standard models of care.\nWearable technology, including activity monitors (\"wearables\"), have the potential to facilitate changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior. A small number of pilot studies have used wearables as key components of an intervention to increase cancer survivors' physical activity, although there are dozens of studies of this nature underway. Some early interventions incorporating wearables (typically single-group designs) have demonstrated improvements in physical activity. Wearables provide automated (and often real-time) feedback on the intensity and duration of physical activity and nonmovement time, which may in itself prompt change. A review of 13 different wearables and associated apps found that they used many of the behavior change techniques typically used by traditional physical activity interventions (eg, self-monitoring, social support, and goal-setting). Given their low cost and wide reach, wearables are ideal tools for scalable health promotion programs. Phillips et al noted that wearables alone are unlikely to generate meaningful, sustained behavior change, and suggested adopting a stepped-care approach to provide adjunct behavior change tools and support to individuals who need them.\nThe primary aim of the ACTIVity And TEchnology (ACTIVATE) Trial was to determine the efficacy of a 12-week intervention (use of a wearable, coupled with goal-setting and telephone-delivered behavioral counseling) for increasing MVPA and reducing sedentary behavior for postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. We hypothesized that the intervention arm would increase MVPA by at least 75 min/wk and reduce sedentary behavior by at least 75 min/d compared with the control arm.\n",

      "value": "Outcomes MVPA was assessed using the Actigraph GT3X+, which was worn on an elasticized belt on the waist over one hip, during waking hours for 7 consecutive days at each data collection time point. Accelerometer data were downloaded and processed using 60-second epochs, using the ActiLife 6.0 software package (Actigraph). A customized program in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) was applied to reduce count data into summary variables. Non-wear time was defined as intervals of at least 60 consecutive minutes of zero counts, with allowance for up to minutes of observations of fewer than 50 counts per minute (cpm) within the non-wear interval. To be considered valid, days of data collection require at least 600 minutes (10 hours) of wear time and no excessive counts (>20,000 cpm).\nMovement count thresholds (cut points) were used to derive MVPA from the Actigraph data. The Actigraph GT3X+ measures accelerations on 3 planes (vertical, antero-posterior, and medio-lateral), generating activity counts as a composite vector magnitude of these 3 axes. Thus, we used the Sasaki vector magnitude cut point (utilizing tri-axial data) of ≥2690 cpm 30 to quantify MVPA. In order to allow direct comparison with past research that has applied different cut points, we also generated secondary measures of MVPA using the Freedson cut point of ≥1952 cpm and the Matthews cut point of ≥760 cpm, both of which utilize data from the vertical axis only. MVPA was examined as average weekly time accumulated (min/wk), and time in \"bouts\" of 10 consecutive minutes or more (min/wk). We acknowledge that the concept of 10-minute bouts for MVPA is no longer incorporated in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, reflecting the contemporary view that the total volume of MVPA affects health outcomes, regardless of how it is accumulated. Nonetheless, we present 10-minute bout data to be consistent with our published protocol. Sedentary behavior was measured using an activPAL, which records time spent in different postures (sitting/ lying, standing, stepping) and the number of postural changes. The device was secured to the anterior midline of the right thigh using a Tegaderm dressing. The activPAL is considered the most accurate device for assessing actual sitting time in adults. Participants wore the device continuously (24 h/d) for 7 consecutive days, only removing it for swimming or bathing.\nData were initially processed using activPAL software version 7.2.32 (PAL Technologies Limited) using default settings. These data were then processed using a customized program in SAS 9.4 that combined activPAL and diary (see below) data. Time spent sleeping, monitor non-wear, and invalid days (wear for <80% of waking hours and waking wear time <10 hours when diary data on sleep were missing) were removed. For each valid day, we calculated time spent sitting (min/d); sitting in prolonged bouts of 20 consecutive minutes or more (min/d), which corresponds to clinical changes in cardio-metabolic biomarkers ; time spent standing (min/d); number of sit-stand transitions; and number of daily steps.\nParticipants were asked to fill in an activity monitor diary each day to record the time they put the Actigraph GT3X+ on and removed it, the time they went to bed, and the time they woke up. Participants also record anytime the activPAL was removed. Diaries were used to cross-check data.\n",

More women in the intervention arm had been treated with surgery plus chemotherapy and radiation therapy (63%) versus the control arm (40%). Retention in the trial was very high, with only 3 women from the intervention arm dropping out of the trial (Fig.). Another 3 women from the intervention arm were missing activPAL data (1 did not wear the device due to skin sensitivities; 2 wore the device, but the battery was no longer working and they did not wish to repeat the measurement). Health issues that potentially affected adherence to the intervention were reported by 3 intervention arm participants: 2 participants reported difficulties with osteoarthritis, and participant underwent surgery during the intervention period. No adverse events were reported during the ACTIVATE Trial.\nGood compliance with the telephone-delivered behavioral counseling was achieved: 27 (68%) of the intervention arm participants received all 5 calls, 10 (25%) received 4 calls, and 3 (7%) received 3 calls. The average Actigraph wear time at T1 was 820 min/d (intervention arm) and 837 min/d (control arm); at T2 it was 832 min/d (intervention arm) and 846 min/d (control arm).\nThe intervention achieved increases in MVPA and MVPA accrued in bouts of at least 10 consecutive minutes, while at the same time reducing total and prolonged sitting time (Table). There was a statistically significant difference in MVPA between groups at T2 (69 min/wk; 95% CI = 22-116; P < .01), favoring the intervention arm.

      "value": "The ACTIVATE intervention, using a combination of mobile health tools and coaching, successfully increased MVPA and decreased sitting time in a sample of Australian postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. We found clear interindividual differences in the patterns of behavior change at the individual level within both the intervention and control arms.\nStrengths of the ACTIVATE Trial include the high rate of adherence to the intervention, and the low dropout rate during the trial. Our use of the Actigraph and activPAL devices to measure our outcome variables reduced the measurement error that is associated with selfreported estimates of physical activity and sedentary behavior. Furthermore, we applied 3 different accelerometer cut points to estimate MVPA, because each method has advantages and limitations. The Sasaki cut point was employed as the primary measure of MVPA because this method uses the acceleration recorded across 3 axes. While the Freedson cut point is the most widely used, it only uses data from the vertical axis, and is based on indirect calorimetry data from university students with a mean age of 24 years. The Matthews cut point also only uses data from a single axis, but its lower threshold captures a broader range of lifestyle and ambulatory activities than the Freedson cut point. Limitations include a sample size that was slightly less than the target set by our sample size calculations (80 vs 82 women) and some missing activPAL data for intervention arm participants. Due to the convenience sampling framework used for recruitment, participants in this trial may have been more motivated and readier to change their behavior than the general breast cancer survivor population, reducing the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the multicomponent nature of our intervention, comprising behavioral feedback (weekly summary of baseline Actigraph and activPAL data) and a goal-setting session; the Garmin Vivofit 2; and telephone-delivered behavioral counseling, means that we cannot discern the efficacy of individual components.\nThere have been few wearable technology-based intervention trials delivered to cancer survivors. Ina pre-post study of 24 adult cancer survivors, Gell et al combined use of the Fitbit One with tailored text messages, self-monitoring, and 3 brief health coaching Wearable technology was also incorporated into a pilot study that aimed to prevent weight gain in African American breast cancer survivors. Participants (n = 35) were randomized to daily self-weighing using smart scales that provided tailored tracking and feedback via an app or website only; daily self-weighing plus physical activity tracking (using a Withings Pulse fitness band); or a control condition. The daily self-weighing plus wearable condition resulted in a small within-group increase in energy expenditure after 6 months (432 kcal/d) and a small change in weight (0.94% reduction).\nDespite the growing body of evidence relating to the health risks associated with sedentary behavior, only a handful of trials have attempted to reduce sitting time in cancer survivors. Trinh et al demonstrated that a web-based intervention, combined with use of a Jawbone wearable device, reduced sedentary behavior in prostate cancer survivors receiving androgen deprivation therapy. This pilot trial (n = 46) resulted in a 455 min/wk reduction in postintervention sedentary behavior. Ina feasibility trial comparing diet and activity interventions delivered via email to a sample of racial and ethnic minority breast cancer survivors, Paxton et al achieved similar reductions in sitting time (304 min/wk in the activity intervention arm; 59 min/wk in the diet intervention arm); however, these findings were based on self-reporting rather than activPAL assessment. A multiple health behavior intervention delivered to colorectal cancer survivors revealed that telephone-delivered health coaching reduced self-reported sitting. The difference between intervention and control groups at the primary endpoint (6 months after the 6-month intervention had concluded) was 39 min/d (95% CI = −82 to 4; P = .06).\nEpidemiologic and experimental evidence suggests that reducing sedentary behavior (and breaking up prolonged bouts of sitting) may improve cardiometabolic health. Prolonged sitting results in compromised glucose and insulin regulation and is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular mortality in the general population. Given that cardiovascular disease is an important cause of death for breast cancer survivors, there is a need for further evidence on the specific applicability of sedentary behavior reduction interventions for breast cancer survivors.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that a wearable technology-based intervention can achieve significant changes in MVPA and sedentary behavior in breast cancer survivors, making it a suitable intervention to administer in larger trials to examine biological and psychosocial endpoints of interest. In particular, the intervention's potential capacity to improve cardiometabolic health in this population is of interest, given its combination of increasing MVPA and decreasing sedentary behavior. Future research is also warranted to examine maintenance of behavior change, and whether possible attenuation overtime maybe reduced by reintroduction of telephone counseling, or by other forms of support such as personalized text messaging. In the longer term, the use of wearable technology has the potential to bean inexpensive and sustainable addition to care provided by clinicians and allied health professionals, or used in broad-reach interventions delivered via telephone support services.\n",
