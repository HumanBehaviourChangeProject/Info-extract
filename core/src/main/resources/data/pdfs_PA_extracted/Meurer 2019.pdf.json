      "value": "An unhealthy lifestyle, especially physical inactivity (Lee et al., 2012) and unhealthy dietary habits (World Health Organization [WHO], 2011a), is recognized as a key determinant of the increased prevalence of noncommunicable chronic diseases (NCDs; WHO, 2011bWHO,  , 2013. In Brazil, the overweight population increased 26.3% in the last 10 years (from 42.6% to 53.8%). The number of obese people increased from 11.8% in 2006 to 18.9% in 2016, representing a growth of 60% (Brasil, 2017b). This scenario has encouraged researchers to develop and test interventions for promoting and restoring population health (Pratt et al., 2015).\nThe main factors associated with this increase in NCDs are the sedentary lifestyle and changes that occurred in the past decades in the food system, causing changes in patterns of food supply, availability, and consumption, marked by increased consumption of ultra-processed foods (Monteiro et al., 2016). In Brazil, more than 14% of the population, above 18 years of age, did not practice any type of physical activity (PA). Among people above 65 years, the prevalence of physical inactivity was 35%. The adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables was found only in one quarter (23.7%) of the population. Additionally, a high percentage of regular consumption (5 or more days/week) of soft drinks (14.6%) was observed (Brasil, 2017b).

      "value": "aim to promote PA and healthy dietary habits. Primary healthcare (PHC) is an advantageous place to promote these actions.\nRecent studies show that educational strategies developed for adults and structured around a theoretical basis are effective in promoting a small to moderate effect on PA, healthy dietary habits, and in improving nutritional status. However, systematic reviews show that few studies report what theories were used in the interventions. Social cognitive theory (SCT) from is promising, providing actions to promote healthy lifestyles. SCT recognizes the important dynamic and reciprocal relationship between behavioral, personal, and environmental influences on people lives, and offers ways to translate the knowledge about determinants into effective strategies for promoting behavior change. The core structures of Bandura's theory are goals, perceived self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and social support).\nAn intervention study about the effects of a program to promote PA and changes in diet for overweight and obese individuals pointed out self-monitoring as one of the effective methods. The other effective strategies were goal setting, increased social support, and self-efficacy. The intervention was based on the SCT and transtheoretic model and conducted through the Internet at the city of California. The program lasted 12 weeks and produced positive effects on PA and eating habits. Another study was done aimed at determining whether a PA and nutritionbased lifestyle modification program could be effectively conducted. With 121 participants and a 16-week-long community-based setting, the program improved PA, body weight, as well as PA social support and eating habits' selfefficacy.\nHowever, almost all studies were undertaken in highincome countries and few were conducted in healthcare settings. Thus, more evidence of effective strategies specific to developing countries like Brazil is still needed to increase the implementation of routine programs in healthcare settings in low-to middle-income countries.\nThe VAMOS strategy, an educational intervention addressed in this study, was found to be promising in promoting PA and mental health among older adult PHC users in Brazil. Additionally, it has been tested with different population groups and in other PHC settings (e.g., the Health Academy Program [HAP];, and has shown effectiveness in improving eating habits and quality of life in hypertensive patients.\nThe PHC is the first level of Brazil's Unified Health System that offers free, universal coverage and serves approximately 75% of the Brazilian population. PHC is characterized by a set of health actions, both individual and collective, directed to the promotion and protection of health, and offers prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of diseases, along with harm reduction and health maintenance. However, PHC has several limitations with communication between services and developing health promotion actions. To overcome these limitations, the HAP was implemented.\nThe HAP is one of the most important health promotion initiatives in the country, with the goal of promoting healthy lifestyles and enhanced quality of life, where the federal and local governments provide funding for facilities and ongoing financial support for operations, program development, and delivery. Currently the HAP is present in 2,847 municipalities, serving more than 51% of the Brazilian municipalities, with 3,790 units being constructed. Given the importance of the HAP service in Brazil's PHC, it is relevant to develop and test possibilities for the improvement of this service.\nOverweight and NCDs are prevalent in the population served by PHC services. This profile, associated with the high turnover of users of the HAP service, raises uncertainties about the continuity of healthcare. Therefore, there is a need for educational activities focused on providing individuals with autonomy and promoting healthy lifestyles. Within this context, the objective of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of the VAMOS strategy in improving usual PA, dietary habits, and anthropometric variables of PHC users in Brazil.\n",

      "value": "The study was conducted in a PHC service named HAP, in the city of Belo Horizonte, capital of Minas Gerais State, which is the sixth most populous city in.\nFocused on users' daily life activities, the HAP units consist of a set of facilities with infrastructure, equipment, and qualified professionals for guidance in the practice of physical and leisure activities, and the promotion of healthy dietary habits at no cost to participants. Sixty-three HAP units currently exist in Belo Horizonte with most units being in operation for 3 to 5 years. Given that \"older\" units typically have a wide range of consolidated activities (including nutritional support), we found it more useful to evaluate the effectiveness of the VAMOS strategy in recently created units that offer similar basic activities, especially PA. To increase comparability, the participating units were defined according to the following parameters: located in an area with similar vulnerability to each other as measured by the health vulnerability index (Prefeitura Municipal de Belo Horizonte, 2013), located in the same region within Belo Horizonte, and created in the past 2 years. According to these parameters, researchers randomly selected two of the three eligible units, and subsequently, randomly assigned them either to the VAMOS strategy intervention group (IG) or to the control group (CG).\nFrequent (regular attendance according to the HAP sheets) users of the HAP, aged 20 years or older, who voluntarily agreed to enroll were eligible to participate in the study. Users were verbally invited to participate in the study by researchers and local PHC healthcare providers, between October of 2014 and July of 2015. Additionally, printed fliers were given to users at the time of their regular check-in and posters were displayed throughout the units' premises.\nSample calculation was performed to ensure adequate statistical power of the main analysis (repeated measures, within and between group interaction for PA), which indicated a minimum sample of 45 participants in each group (CG and IG). The following parameters were adopted: a level of significance of 5%, 80% statistical power, 0.5 correlation for observations between the time points of the study (average correlation), and an effect size of 0.15 (small effect;. Previous PA promotion interventions in PHC identified a small to moderate effect size. Sample calculations were performed using the G*Power 3 software.\nThe study was conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines and was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at the State Department of Health (No. 767.704).

The main SCT constructs addressed in weekly meetings include selfefficacy by means of an iterative feedback to increase confidence and setting individual goals for PA and dietary habits. The self-monitoring of these habits was done with the use of pedometers and written records, providing self-incentive and guided action to reach the predetermined goals, identification of social support, such as friends and family who could support the changes, identification of individual barriers, outcome expectancies, facing changes in PA, and dietary habits. The meetings took place in conversation circles, which allows group members to reflect, debate, and share experiences related to a subject.\nFor 12 successive weeks, IG members participated in the VAMOS strategy. Participants were organized into groups limited to 20 individuals. Each group attended weekly 60-minute meetings covering different chapters of the VAMOS material (Supplemental Appendix 1; available in the online version of the article).

      "value": "Demographic data included participant's age, sex, professional occupation, level of education, number of household members, and household income per capita. The health profile of each participant was assessed based on self-report for NCDs using a criterion similar to Brazilian national studies. All data were collected at the PHC units, face-to-face by un-blinded nutrition students, nutritionists, and physical education professionals who were periodically trained by the researchers. A pilot test identified the adequacy of the research instruments for the population studied. A total of nine subjects participated in a small pilot study designed to determine the adequacy of the linguistic content, questionnaire fluency, layout, and time for application. The pilot study included subjects from both sexes with characteristics similar to those of the sample of interest (six women and three men,;63.5 ± 8.9 years old).\nPhysical Activity. Usual PA was objectively assessed with accelerometers (ActiGraph, GT3X and GT3X+). Each participant was instructed to use the accelerometer for 7 consecutive days, removing it only to sleep, bathe, or perform activities involving water. The device was attached to an elastic belt and fixed to the right side of the hip. Only days with a minimum of 10 hours of recordings of daily activity were considered to be valid. Participants had to have at least 4 days of valid recordings including one weekend day. Data were collected at a frequency of 30 Hz and analyzed using 60-second epochs. Periods with zeros in a row for 60 minutes or more (with 2 minutes of tolerance) were interpreted as non-wear time and were excluded from the analysis.\nThe intensity of the activities was measured using the cutoff points: moderate PA (100-2,689 counts/min) and vigorous PA (≥2,690 counts/min;. Since the previous authors did not report cutoff points for sedentary time, 0 to 99 counts/min was used. Analyses were performed using the ActiLife 6.10 software (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL). The values were set according to the number of valid days and hours of use. To estimate weekly PA, the average daily minutes of moderate-vigorous PA bouts was multiplied by seven. The classification followed the recommendations of the WHO (2010), and participants with weekly moderate-vigorous PA of ≥150 minutes (accumulated over a minimum period of 10 minutes) were classified as active.\nDietary Habits. Participants' dietary habits were analyzed for number of daily meals, time devoted to eating, and dietary intake proposed by the Sistema de Vigilância de fatores de risco e proteção para Doenças Crônicas por inquérito telefônico (VIGITEL;, that is, raw and cooked vegetables, visible meat fat, chicken skin, and fruit consumption. The validity and reliability of VIGITEL have been demonstrated in a previous study.\nIn addition, a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) was applied. The FFQ consisted of 15 food items and was designed based on a previous study involving PHC users. The average intake frequency of each food item during the previous 6 months was determined. The food items were classified into two groups: fresh and minimally processed foods (raw vegetables, cooked vegetables, fruit, milk, meat, fish, salad, and tubers/roots), and ultra-processed foods (sausage products, sandwiches, cookies, sweets, snacks/fatty snacks, sodas, drink mixes, and industrial seasonings). For analysis, the frequency of consumption reported by the participants in response to the FFQ was divided into regular intake-weekly frequency equal to or greater than five times-and irregular intake-weekly frequency of less than five times.\nAnthropometric Assessment. Anthropometric measurements included body weight, height, and waist circumference (WC). Weight was measured with a calibrated digital scale, with an accuracy of 0.1 kg. Height was measured using a stadiometer with a fixed vertical backboard and adjustable headboard, with an accuracy of 0.1 cm. The weight and height were measured with individuals wearing light clothing and barefoot, without props or objects on the head and pockets.\nBody mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. BMI was classified differently for adults (20-59 years; and older adults (aged 60 and above; The Nutrition Screening Initiative, 1994). For analysis, the categories \"overweight\" and \"obese\" were pooled into \"excess weight.\" Weight-related analyses (weight, BMI, and WC) included only participants classified as \"excess weight\" (BMI ≥ 25) during baseline assessments. Additionally, we investigated whether normal weight participants increased their weight and WC from baseline to postintervention assessment.\nWC was measured with a tape measure at the midpoint between the iliac crest and the last rib, without compressing any tissues. For WC, the cutoff point proposed by WHO (2011b) was employed: risk of metabolic complications for men = no risk (WC < 94.0 cm), increased (WC > 94.0 cm), and substantially increased (WC > 102.0 cm), and women = no risk (WC < 80.0 cm), increased (WC > 80.0 cm), and substantially increased (WC > 88.0 cm).\n",

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check data distribution, and descriptive statistics was used to characterize the participants. Between-group comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney test for medians and the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test for proportions. To assess the effectiveness of the VAMOS strategy, between-and withingroup comparisons were made for the following outcomes: usual PA and anthropometric variables. Two-way repeatedmeasures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used with a post hoc LSD test. When sphericity was violated, Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied.\nThe method of Generalized Estimating Equations was applied for between-and within-group comparison of the categorical variables of dietary habits (meal characteristics, regular intake of fresh and minimally processed foods, and ultra-processed foods). The chi-square test was used to compare the proportions of users classified as active. The analysis was adjusted by the variables that differed significantly between groups at T1 of the study (education and length of participation in the HAP). The magnitude of difference was quantified by calculating the effect size (ES), where an ES of 0 to 0.49 was classified as small, 0.50 to 0.79 as moderate, and ≥0.80 as high. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed to determine the effectiveness of the intervention and to keep all participants with non-missing baseline outcome measurements. In case of missing values at T2 (19.6%), imputation was used by replacing the baseline value following the Last Observation Carried Forward approach (completers only analysis found the same results for PA and dietary habits). For usual PA, the percentage of missing values at T2 was 24.6%.\n",

      "value": "The VAMOS strategy was effective in promoting PA, healthy eating, and weight loss among users of a Brazilian PHC service. Results show that participants in IG increased the daily practice of moderate-vigorous PA and the intake of raw vegetables, while decreasing the intake of ultra-processed foods and their overall weight and BMI.\nModerate-vigorous PA is associated with many health benefits. Studies of American adults at high risk of a cardiovascular event showed that a daily increase of 10 minutes in moderate-vigorous PA reduced the risk of mortality from all causes by 42%. Although lower (about 5 minutes daily) than in the above-mentioned study, the present study also identified an increase in the daily duration of moderatevigorous PA (ES = 0.32). This result maybe related to the different PA intensities and behavioral strategies proposed by the intervention, as well as to the regular practice of PA by the participants, which could have improved musculoskeletal fitness that permitted to increase PA intensity. A review of reviews summarizes that PA promotion interventions in PHC have a small to moderate positive effect on increasing PA levels. In the present study, an increase in the total duration of PA was also expected. However, this result was not confirmed, probably because of the high rate of total PA among the participants as opposed to commonly investigated samples, which are composed of inactive or sedentary participants.  There were also significant improvements in the intake of raw vegetables and ultra-processed foods among IG participants. In the course of the VAMOS strategy, conceptual issues relative to food classification were presented and discussed. The participants were encouraged to reflect on everyday dietary habits, as well as to identify opportunities to increase the intake of fresh and minimally processed foods and to reduce ultra-processed food consumption. The replacement of ultra-processed foods with natural foods by increasing the intake of raw vegetables was often reported as a strategy used by the participants. The intake of raw vegetables and fresh or minimally processed foods should be encouraged in the population, considering the inverse relationship of these foods with mortality and their association with the prevention and control of NCDs. The reduced intake of ultra-processed foods is an important result because it suggests a reduction in sodium intake, which excessive consumption is associated with cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. These results are similar to those reported in other studies conducted in the PHC context.\nAnthropometric assessment indicated the presence of overweight and abdominal obesity inmost of the participants (more than 60%). Similar results have been reported for the Brazilian population and for other countries in the Americas. Modest weight and BMI reductions in the IG were observed among participants classified as overweight or obese during T1 with no change in weight-related measures among participants classified as normal weight. These results demonstrate the potential for VAMOS to help overweight and obese individuals to lose weight. Recent studies show that between 2006 and 2016 the average increase in prevalence of overweight and obesity in Brazilian adults was 1.21 percentage point and 0.73 percentage point, respectively. While our results were modest, the VAMOS strategy shows promise as an important first step in turning this trend around.   Furthermore, evidence suggests that weight loss is associated with benefits for the majority of obesity-related comorbidities and programs, such as HAP and VAMOS, may promote modest weight loss consistent with public health recommendations. In this respect, a study conducted in the Brazilian PHC setting indicated a positive impact on anthropometric variables after 6 months of intervention and other intervention study at the same service with women showed a weight loss of 1.3 kg after 11 months. This study showed positive findings, which indicate that educational activities should be encouraged in PHC settings in low-to middle-income countries as recommended by the WHO (2011a). In the PHC, professionals support the process of self-care. These actions help individuals identify and reflect on the difficulties and the likelihood of making changes in their lifestyle, thereby increasing empowerment and autonomy.\nThe present study has some strengths. It was conducted in a health promotion service within the cultural context of the participants, the intervention was based on a consistent theoretical framework and enabled users' participation, intentionto-treat analysis, and objective measurement of usual PA and weight were used, increasing reliability of the results. One limitation of this study was the difference in educational level between participants in the CG and IG groups. However, all analyses were adjusted by education to minimize the impact of this variable on the results. Another limitation is that the intervention was delivered by the research team, which was not blinded. Furthermore, the study only included two HAP units since the eligibility criteria established that only newly implemented units be included. In addition, the researchers did not evaluate the impact of the intervention on SCT constructs. Future studies should replicate the VAMOS strategy in a representative number of HAP units, regardless of their implementation time, and the intervention should be conducted by PHC professionals. Additionally, different implementation strategies should be evaluated to determine the cost-effectiveness of the interventions. Users' health, especially their anthropometric variables, should be monitored fora longer period to determine the impact of the strategy on this indicator.\nThis study demonstrated the effectiveness of the VAMOS strategy, which increased time spent in moderate-vigorous intensity PA, improved dietary habits, and reduced weight of users of a PHC service in Brazil. The results suggest that the VAMOS strategy maybe suitable to other PHC settings and it could be delivered by health professionals with adequate training and support. Currently, training is provided free of charge by the team of researchers from the Federal University of Santa Catarina,, to interested parties.\n",
