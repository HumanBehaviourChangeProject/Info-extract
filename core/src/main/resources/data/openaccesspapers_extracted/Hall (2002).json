Antidepressant efficacy in such a context may differ from that obtained from more extensive psychotherapy. One important question is the effect of psychological intervention (PI) when added to antidepressant therapy.\nA second question is the relative efficacy of the 2 drugs. On the basis of the extant literature, we deemed differences in efficacy between bupropion and nortriptyline unlikely, and we did not predict differences between the 2. We did expect, however, that both would produce higher abstinence rates than placebo.\nThus, the following hypotheses were proposed: (1) Abstinence rates will be higher in participants receiving active antidepressant treatment, whether bupropion or nortriptyline, during a 52-week period, than for those receiving placebo. (2) Independent of drug, abstinence rates will be higher for participants receiving PI than for those receiving MM alone. (3) Active drug conditions combined with PI will be more efficacious than the other experimental conditions in producing abstinence.\n",

We encapsulated both drugs to maintain the patency of the bupropion formulation and to provide a blinded drug.

For nortriptyline, lactose placebo and active drug were encapsulated in powdered form. For bupropion, Wellbutrin SR tablets (Glaxo Wellcome Inc, Research Triangle Park, NC) or similar-sized placebo tablets were inserted into lactose-filled capsules. All capsules were secured with a gelatin mixture to prevent opening.\nNortriptyline drug dose was titrated for each participant until a therapeutic serum level (50-150 ng/mL) was obtained. All participants assigned to active nortriptyline hydrochloride received 25 mg/d for 3 days, followed by 50 mg/d for 4 days. At the end of the week, serum levels of nortriptyline were assessed. Dosage was increased to 75 mg/d if a therapeutic serum level had not been reached. At week 4, serum levels were assessed again and, if necessary, drug dosage was increased to 100 mg/d. At week 6, serum levels were assessed to determine final dose. At the end of week 12, drug dose was decreased by 25 mg every 2 days, with the final drug administration being 25 mg over 3 days. Whenever a dose was titrated fora participant receiving active drug, the dose was titrated fora participant receiving placebo. Titration was performed by a physician who had no contact with participants or clinical staff. The mean nortriptyline blood level for participants abstinent at week 6 was 59.9 ng/mL (SD, 25.2 ng/mL). We report only blood levels for abstinent participants, since nicotine is known to result in lowered nortriptyline levels. Daily nortriptyline hydrochloride dosages at week 7 were as follows: 50 mg/d, n=2; 75 mg/d, n=26; 100 mg/d, n=25, and 125 mg/d, n=5.\nBupropion hydrochloride dosage began at 150 mg/d for the first 3 days. The dosage was increased to 300 mg/d, where it remained until week 12, when the dose was decreased to 150 mg for 3 days, then discontinued. Dose reductions occurred if participants reported unpleasant adverse effects. Mean bupropion blood level for abstinent subjects was 36.0 ng/mL. At week 7, all participants receiving bupropion were receiving 300 mg/d.\nParticipants returned pill bottles at each clinic visit. Pills were counted and number of pills taken was recorded.

We used SAS PROC MIXED version 6.12 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). When abstinence was the dependent variable, we also used the GLIMMIX Macro for SAS (SAS Institute Inc), which interacts with PROC MIXED to modify it so that it is appropriate for dichotomous data.

      "value": "As predicted, bupropion and nortriptyline were more efficacious than placebo in producing abstinence when measured by point-prevalence abstinence during the course of a year. Similarly, PI was more efficacious than MM alone. The hypothesis that PI would add to antidepressant treatment was not supported. As has been the casein other recent studies (eg, Hall et al 3 ), MDD did not predict failure to quit smoking.\nThe equivalent effectiveness of bupropion and nortriptyline, a generic drug, and nortriptyline's much lower cost, suggest that it might be a useful alternative to bupropion for some smokers. The drugs have different adverse effect and risk profiles, however. Nortriptyline has been shown to be related to an increased rate of serious cardiac events in patients with ischemic heart disease. The present study does not indicate whether it is the content of the PI or increased contact that increases abstinence. Visual inspection of data values in suggests potential differences between MM-placebo, and the remaining 3 conditions (MM-active drug, MM/PIplacebo, and MM/PI-active drug) at weeks 12, 24, and 52. The PI did not increase abstinence rates when added to the active drug; it may bring abstinence rates in the placebo condition to about the same level as active drug. Additional research in the role of psychological treatment with antidepressants is warranted. The interaction of drug with history of MDD did not reach statistically significant levels (P = .07). Inspection of the data suggests potential superiority of bupropion for smokers with a history of MDD, but virtually no difference in patients without a history of MDD. The effect may warrant further examination in a study designed to address this question.\nAbstinence rates in the present study were lower than those reported in earlier work with nortriptyline and bupropion. This difference may reflect the changing nature of participants entering smoking treatment trials. Smokers in the present study smoked fewer cigarettes, were less likely to have a partner or spouse, were more likely to be blue collar or service workers, and were less likely to be white. A recent study has shown decreasing abstinence rates in smoking cessation studies during the past 25 years. The authors of that study attribute this to increasing difficulty in quitting cigarettes among individuals who continue to smoke despite current pressures.\nAlthough nortriptyline and bupropion were significantly more efficacious than placebo when pointprevalence rates were compared, this was not the case when 1-year continuous abstinence rates were evaluated. Also, as the modest week 24 and 52 abstinence rates indicate, the field must continue to seek more efficacious treatments. Two recent clinical trials, both with acceptable rigor, one published in 1996 and the second in 1999, 2 failed to find differences between placebo and active NRT. Recent reviews of NRT effectiveness have suggested decreasing efficacy of nicotine patch, but not nicotine gum, since they were introduced in the 1980s. As the population of smokers changes, interventions may experience a declining efficacy.\nGiven the information provided to participants as part of the informed consent procedures, it is not surprising that they were able to correctly guess which drug they had received. Indeed, in studies of drugs with detectable effects that report the maintenance of the blind, participants are often able to correctly guess which drug they received. Nevertheless, given the complex blinding procedures we used because a placebo bupropion sustained-release capsule was unavailable, it was reassuring that the bupropion recipients were no more likely than the nortriptyline recipients to guess their drug.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial to report the use of out-of-study medication during the follow-up period. We found a high rate of such use (54 patients [25% of the sample]), but only 14 of these 54 participants were abstinent. Recoding these abstinent participants as smoking does not change the overall findings. They represent less than 6% of the sample and were fairly equally distributed across conditions. Nevertheless, given the increasing availability of smoking cessation medications, we recommend that studies routinely report these data to better understand outcomes and the processes of abstinence and relapse.\nThe results of the present study are limited by the select nature of the sample resulting from the need to meet both criteria necessary to complete the research, such as availability during the course of the year, and medical exclusionary criteria.\nSubmitted for publication; final revision received November (REPRINTED) ARCH GEN PSYCHIATRY/ VOL 59, OCT 2002 WWW.ARCHGENPSYCHIATRY.COM 935\n",
