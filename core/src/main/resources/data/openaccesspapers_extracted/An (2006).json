      "value": "SSISTING TOBACCO CESSAtion is an important component of comprehensive tobacco control. Increasing the use of evidencebased treatments is a national health priority and has the potential to save millions of lives. The US national action plan for tobacco cessation calls for systems-level changes and quality improvement efforts to increase delivery of tobacco treatment in clinical settings. The plan also recommends the creation of a national telephone quitline network providing public access to counseling and pharmacologic treatments without requiring tobacco users to visit their healthcare provider.\nWhile telephone counseling has been shown to bean effective aid to smoking cessation compared with interventions without personal contact, it is not clear that access to telephone care provides any additional benefit when added to face-to-face interventions as might occur as part of routine healthcare. Access to telephone care may do little if patients already regularly discuss tobacco with their healthcare providers and receive assistance in quitting. Alternatively, the increased access and convenience of telephone-based services may improve outcomes over brief office-based interventions.\nUnderstanding the possible benefits of telephone care in relation to routine healthcare provider intervention is important at several levels. For clinicians and administrators, this information identifies the potential value of adding telephone care to existing clinical programs. For public health and policy experts, this information helps define the role of telephone care as part of a comprehensive cessation program, such as the national action plan.\nTo assess the potential benefits of telephone care above and beyond routine intervention by healthcare providers, we conducted a 2-group prospective randomized controlled trial within the Veterans Health Administration system. Performance measures of tobacco treatment at Veterans Affairs medical centers (VAMCs) show high rates of documentation of tobacco use status (99%) and advice to quit (75%), and tobacco treatment medications are part of the national Veterans Affairs formulary. The objective of the present study was to determine if telephone care, consisting of counseling and provision of smoking cessation medications, increased abstinence from cigarette smoking compared with standard intervention as part of routine healthcare.\n",

The telephone care protocol consisted of 7 calls scheduled over a 2-month period in a relapse-sensitive fashion. Additional courtesy calls were scheduled at the discretion of the counselor to reinforce motivation to quit or to followup after relapse. Subjects received counseling for up to 3 quit attempts during the 12 months after enrolling in the study.\nTelephone counselors encouraged use of pharmacologic therapy.

      "value": "Among smokers who are interested in quitting, the option of receiving services over the telephone dramatically increases the use of behavioral counseling and pharmacologic therapy. Even compared with very high rates of brief healthcare provider intervention in the standard care group, smokers receiving telephone care were more successful in achieving abstinence.\nThe increase in smoking cessation observed in this study is consistent with delivery of a combined behavioral and pharmacologic intervention. A recent review Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio. *Unless otherwise indicated, data are reported as number/total responders (percentage) of subjects. †Denominators vary owing to item nonresponses. ‡At 12 months, participants were considered to have used counseling programs or medications if they answered affirmatively for use of these drugs or services at either 3-or 12-month follow-up. A participant who indicated receiving a specific service or using a drug at the 3-month evaluation but who was not reached for the 12-month evaluation was classified as having received this service or drug by 12-month follow-up. A participant who indicated they had not used a specific service or drug at 3 months and was not reached at the 12-month evaluation was classified as \"missing\" for analysis of that service by 12 months.\nsuggests that telephone counseling alone increases the odds of quitting by. Reviews of pharmacologic agents commonly prescribed in this study suggest that they increase the odds of quitting by 1.66 for nicotine gum (95% CI, 1.52-1.81), 1.74 for the nicotine patch (95% CI, 1.57-1.93), and 1.97 for slowrelease bupropion (95% CI, 1.67-2.34). The odds of smoking cessation in our telephone care group were higher than might be expected for either telephone counseling or pharmacologic therapy alone, and this finding reinforces the recommendations of the national guidelines that combined behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for tobacco use is optimal.\nTelephone care resulted in larger increases in sustained abstinence (of 6 months or more) than in shortterm (7-day) abstinence at 12 months. Proactive telephone counseling has been shown in prior studies to reduce relapse rates. The telephone care group in the present study also had more immediate access to services than participants in the standard care group (who needed to visitor contact their healthcare provider to initiate treatment). More immediate assistance in the telephone care group may have accelerated progress toward smoking cessation compared with the standard care group and contributed to the finding of a greater increase in sustained abstinence.\nAn important lesson from this study is that large differences in provision of services are needed to produce meaningful differences in smoking cessation rates. Many attempts to improve delivery of tobacco treatment result in modest increases in use of services with little or no measurable increase in cessation. This does not necessarily mean that smoking cessation treatments are not effective, but rather that the magnitude of the change in services delivery is often not sufficient to lead to measurable increases in cessation. These findings highlight the need for major structural changes in the delivery of tobacco treatment services such as those tested herein and proposed in the national action plan.\nThis study has several limitations. First, because there was no in-person contact between study staff and participants, it was not logistically feasible to perform biochemical validation of smoking status. Prior analyses suggest that underreporting of smoking in field trials, such as this one, is very low. Another limitation is that we tested the intervention in a select population. Participants were predominantly male, elderly, and had multiple medical problems as well as extensive smoking histories with past unsuccessful quit attempts. The 4% abstinence rate at 6 months in the standard care group maybe somewhat lower than expected among daily smokers in the general population. Past unsuccessful attempts to quit despite use of pharmacologic therapy and continued smoking despite diagnosis of smoking-related diseases may indicate that participants in this study had particularly substantial barriers to quitting. Of note, the use of pharmacologic therapy (without counseling) did not seem to offer substantial benefits in the standard care group. The relative lack of efficacy of the nicotine patch in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease has been noted previously. Given these issues, it is possible that the magnitude of the treatment effect of telephone care compared with standard care would be different in a more general population of smokers.\nFinally, the total number and duration of telephone contacts in this study was greater than has been reported in other studies of telephone counseling. Given the dose-response relationship between the intensity of counseling and smoking cessation outcomes, 3 future studies seeking similar results would need to plan to provide a similarly intensive intervention.\nThe findings of this study suggest several avenues for future research. Telephone care provided in this study combined increased access to behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. Because these 2 components were offered together, we are unable to identify their unique contribution to the overall benefit of the intervention. Future studies might compare increased access to pharmacologic therapy vs combined behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. Additional work is also needed to develop methods to integrate telephone care into existing healthcare delivery systems and compare reactive and proactive strategies for patient recruitment and referral to treatment services.\nThis study shows that telephone care increases use of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments and results in increased smoking cessation compared with brief healthcare provider intervention as part of routine healthcare. At a minimum, telephone care for smoking cessation should be made available to veterans who are interested in stopping smoking. The findings of this study lend additional support to the recommendation fora national network of quitlines that would make these services available to all tobacco users in this country.
