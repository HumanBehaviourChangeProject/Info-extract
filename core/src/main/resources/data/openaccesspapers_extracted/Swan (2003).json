Only Hurt et al, however, used dosages other than 300 mg/d. In that study, abstinence rates for 150 and 300 mg of bupropion SR were higher than those for placebo at the end of treatment. Although abstinence rates were higher at the end of treatment for the 300-mg dose compared with the 150-mg dose, superior efficacy for the higher dose was not observed at 12 months. The published trials of bupropion SR also included intensive in-person behavioral counseling during and/or following treatment, much more contact than individuals receiving a bupropion SR prescription from their physician will typically receive. To our knowledge, success rates for bupropion SR in combination with truly minimal counseling, as defined by recent guidelines, have not been reported. Therefore, recommendations based on the results from these studies are of unknown applicability to settings outside the context of a clinical efficacy trial. Evaluation of bupropion SR's effectiveness in a primary care-oriented healthcare system setting is important because it is the most likely form of delivery of this medication if it is included as a covered healthcare insurance benefit.\n",

For analysis of outcomes, nonsmoking was defined as the self-report of no smoking, not even a puff, within the 7 days before follow-up contact. An intention-to-treat approach was used, in which individuals who were unavailable for follow-up at either point were considered to be smoking. A logistic regression analysis, with terms for bupropion SR dose (150 or 300 mg), type of counseling (FC or ZAP), and a dose񮽙counseling interaction term, was used to evaluate their relationship to smoking outcome (nonsmoking or smoking) at each of the 2 follow-up points. Main effects for dose and type of counseling were tested for statistical significance in the presence and absence of a term for their interaction. The effectiveness (proportion of sample reporting nonsmoking) of the higher dose was expressed relative to that observed for the lower dose using the odds ratio (OR) at each follow-up. A similar approach was used to express the effectiveness of the more intensive counseling relative to the less intensive counseling. A number-needed-to-treat (NNT) estimate (and corresponding 95% confidence interval) was also computed for each significant main effect at each follow-up point to facilitate clinical interpretation. The NNT was calculated as follows: 1/ (proportion reporting nonsmoking following treatment with the more effective treatment−proportion reporting nonsmoking following treatment with the less effective treatment). The resulting NNT can then be interpreted as the number of smokers who, if treated with the more effective treatment rather than the less effective treatment, would yield 1 additional posttreatment nonsmoker (ie, 1 more posttreatment nonsmoker than the number expected from application of the less effective treatment). In general, more effective treatments are associated with smaller estimates of NNT. Pairwise group comparisons of nonsmoking rates used 񮽙 2 tests of association. After combining counseling groups with similar dosages, 񮽙 2 tests of association were used to evaluate the association between presence or absence of an adverse or abstinence effect and the 150-or 300-mg dose level at the shortterm follow-up.\nThe present study had 80% power (with sample size ranging from 378-383 in each of the 4 treatment groups of the design) to detect an absolute difference of 3.2% or larger in percentage nonsmoking between groups at each of the 2 follow-up points.\n",

The combined point-prevalence nonsmoking rate in the 300-mg groups at 3 months (30.9%) is also consistent with that reported by Hurt et al at 3 months (29.5%). At 12 months, the combined nonsmoking rate in the groups receiving 300 mg in the present study (29.4%) was somewhat higher than that reported by Hurt et al (23.1%), but was consistent with that reported by Jorenby et al 2 (30.3%).\nWhile a nonsignificant 10.5% advantage for higherintensity telephone counseling was apparent at 3 months, this advantage increased to 20.8% at 12 months and was significant. Inspection of the 12-month results for the 150-and 300-mg FC groups reveals that, while a high treatment effectiveness was maintained from 3 to 12 months in the 300-mg FC group, the point prevalence of nonsmoking actually increased during that interval for the 150-mg FC group, possibly because of the increased use of behavioral skills, a feature of the yearlong FC counseling. Given the equivalence across groups for contact rates at first follow-up, we do not believe this to bean artifact of coding those unavailable for follow-up as smokers under the intent-to-treat approach to analysis. The contact rates at 12 months were lower in the FC groups than in the ZAP groups and, if anything, coding those with missing outcomes as smokers would have biased results away from the conclusion of an increase in nonsmoking. Caution is warranted until the inference of increased recycling in this group is confirmed in an independent sample.\nAlthough both counseling arms involved less contact than in previous studies, participants still received more careful screening, educational, and behavioral follow-up than most patients would receive in the course of obtaining a prescription from their physician. These study results provide a workable model for one way to ensure that patients using bupropion SR receive comparable safety and effectiveness outcomes to those obtained in the efficacy trials.\nCompared with 150 mg, individuals receiving the 300-mg form of bupropion SR reported significantly more adverse reactions, including difficulty sleeping, shakiness/ tremor, difficulty concentrating, and gastrointestinal disruption. Of participants, 48.0% in the higher-dose group reported experiencing difficulty with sleeping at some point after starting treatment. This rate is higher than that reported by Hurt et al 1 (34.6%), and may result from the method of assessment used in the present study (providing a list of adverse reactions to the participants and asking them to indicate whether they experienced them since starting to take the study medication). The proportion of those who indicated that they deliberately took less bupropion SR than prescribed was almost 7 times greater among those prescribed 300 mg compared with those assigned to receive 150 mg. This finding suggests the presence of an effort to reduce dosage in those taking 300 mg, possibly as away to manage adverse effects. Most important, however, in this actual practice setting, bupropion SR was not associated with serious adverse events such as seizures or death.\nSmokers taking the higher-dose bupropion SR were less likely to report a desire to smoke following treatment for smoking, a key variable in the possible explanation of the higher dose's relative success at 3 months. Other than this association, there was no evidence in favor of the higher dose for reported lower frequency of abstinence effects. This pattern is, overall, consistent with previously reported findings 1 in which few, if any, differences between the dosage groups were noted for abstinence effects over the course of treatment and follow-up.\nThe lack of blinding in this trial was a necessary aspect of conducting this work within the context of a large healthcare system in which ethical and practical concerns are of highest priority. Of course, lack of blinding can introduce biased estimates of treatment effects that emanate from the physician, the smoking cessation counselor, or the patient in the form of decreased or increased expectations for effectiveness depending on the dose and/or nature of adjunctive counseling to which the patient is randomized. Regarding the present study's estimates of point prevalence of nonsmoking, the comparability of the present results with those from Hurt et al 1 would suggest that the impact of not blinding on the primary conclusions of this analysis is small. Depending on bupropion SR dose, the lack of blinding could also lead to an overreporting or underreporting of adverse events and abstinence effects, as described earlier herein. Therefore, this portion of the analysis should be viewed with caution.\nBecause this study was conducted in an actual practice setting and relied entirely on telephone and mailed interaction between study participants and project staff, several methodological refinements (biochemical confirmation of nonsmoking, confirmation of medication adherence, measures of continuous abstinence, and placebo arms) usually found in clinical trials of efficacy were not logistically feasible and, thus, could represent limitations. The absence of biochemical confirmation of nonsmoking may have resulted in an overestimation of the true abstinence rate. Assuming that misreporting of nonsmoking would occur equally across all 4 treatment groups, the impact on conclusions derived would be minimal. Moreover, a comparison of nonsmoking rates obtained in the present trial with those reported from the 2 previous trials 1,2 of bupropion SR suggests a consistency across the 3 studies. Previous analyses suggest that the rate of underreporting of smoking in afield trial of this type maybe minimal. Another limitation of the present study stems from the lack of objective measurement of adherence to the therapeutic regimen. The use of automated pill counters or blood levels can provide accurate estimates of medication adherence, but their use in afield trial of this size was not feasible economically. A third limitation is related to our use of 7-day point prevalence of smoking at each of the follow-up visits as the outcome measure rather than an assessment of continuous abstinence. Our decision was based on a desire to minimize contact with the participants during the follow-up to maintain fidelity with actual practice. Therefore, all comparisons with previous studies are based on self-reported point-prevalence estimates of nonsmoking.\nWe experienced better rates of unavailability for follow-up (20.8% at 3 months and 14.6% at 12 months) than those reported by the efficacy trials. Hurt et al 1 reported that 35.6% of participants failed to complete the 12-month follow-up, while this percentage was 34.8% in the study by In the latter study, 19.8% of all participants provided no information about smoking status following treatment. In the present study, the convention of coding those unavailable for follow-up as smokers may have resulted in an underestimate of the nonsmoking rate in this effectiveness trial. While the randomized controlled trial remains the gold standard for determining the efficacy of new treatments, there is increasing concern about the generalizability of results from these trials to actual practice settings. The results from randomized controlled trials may have limited generalizability because of the unusual circumstances in which treatments are delivered, the often extreme nature of exclusion criteria that can result in homogeneous patient populations, and the use of generally higher doses of medication than what are likely to be prescribed by practicing physicians in the normal course of patient care. Policy decisions based on these trials could lead to inefficient use of resources, neglect of equally effective older treatments, or excessively high dosing levels. Recently published work lends support to the notion that use of pharmaceutical aids for smoking cessation in actual practice is much shorter in duration than prescribing regimens call for, tends to occur in the absence of concurrent behavioral counseling, results in quitting at a lower rate than reported in clinical trials, and/or demonstrates no long-term advantage for their use over nonpharmacological smoking cessation aids. Sole reliance on data from randomized controlled trials of treatments such as bupropion SR for policy decisions concerning, for example, which pharmaceutical aids to include on the formulary of a managed care organization is not warranted in view of these findings. Results from the present analysis of the first effectiveness trial of bupropion SR to be conducted, in which the higher dose of bupropion SR does not demonstrate a clear advantage for long-term cessation, further suggest that caution be used in extrapolating the results of previously published randomized controlled trials of the agent to the millions of smokers who seek to quit.\nIt is important to place the overall results in the context of what is known about quit rates achieved through other behavioral methods likely to be encountered in a healthcare setting. Quit rates for self-quitters are estimated to range from 2% to 5%. Brief physician advice alone to stop smoking results in an absolute increase in quit rates of 2%, which can be increased to 5% with additional assistance and written materials. Intensive behavioral counseling alone (such as that done in the placebo groups in the trials of Hurt 1 and Jorenby 2 and colleagues) results in quit rates ranging from 12% to 19%. Compared with the success rates achieved with behavioral treatment alone, the combination of bupropion SR and minimal adjunctive support can lead to a substantial improvement in quit rates. Even the least intensive treatment evaluated in the present study (150 mg of bupropion SR plus ZAP) resulted in a short-term quit rate of approximately 24%. Clinicians who treat smoking patients should be encouraged that prescribing bupropion SR and enrollment of the patient in some form of minimally to moderately intensive treatment will result in a reduction of the overall number of smoking patients in their practice.\nThis trial successfully recruited and safely treated more than 1500 patients with bupropion SR without requiring an office visit. Although bupropion SR is a medication with serious adverse effects in higher-risk patients, we were able to safely and successfully screen patients entirely over the telephone based on a protocol that included medical backup. Although similar results may not be obtained simply by writing a prescription in the course of an acutecare visit without any screening, education, or follow-up, this method provides a workable model to ensure that patients using bupropion SR receive comparable outcomes to those obtained in the efficacy trials. Since completion of this trial, GHC has incorporated this protocol into its integrated smoking cessation service and has successfully screened via the telephone and treated several thousand more patients with bupropion SR. This has proved extremely popular with physicians, because it allows them to focus on motivating patients to quit without requiring excessive office visits for counseling. This approach may hold considerable promise for increasing the reach of the most effective means of quitting, medication combined with behavioral counseling. Given the results of this study, it is reasonable for physicians to consider initiating and maintaining therapy with bupropion SR at 150 mg rather than 300 mg for many patients based on safety and adverse effect concerns, given their equal long-term efficacy. It is also important to emphasize with patients that they can significantly increase their likelihood of long-term success by including follow-up counseling of some form. The good news is that there are new models being developed that can accomplish this in a manner less burdensome to the busy practicing physician.\n",
