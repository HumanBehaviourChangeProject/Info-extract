      "value": "CCELERATING THE REDUCtion in the population prevalence of smoking will require innovative approaches to reach and treat current smokers. The Internet has the potential to reach millions of smokers per year with evidence-based cessation treatment. The key components of recommended treatment, namely, problem solving and skills training, Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacotherapy, and social support, can be provided efficiently, proactively, and in real time and can be sustained for as long as the user desires. Few large-scale, rigorous trials of Web-based cessation interventions have been conducted and they have yielded mixed results, with abstinence rates ranging from 7% at 3 months through 21% at 12 months. Studies have varied in rigor on several dimensions, including design, sample size, sample selection and bias, intervention content, length of follow-up, attrition rate, and outcome metrics, but recent meta-analyses provide evidence of effectiveness. Because combined treatments are associated with better outcomes, 4 adding proactive telephone counseling to Internet treatment may further improve the effect on the population. National guidelines for treating tobacco use and dependence recommend that healthcare professionals and healthcare provision systems promote telephone quitline use. Available throughout the United States, telephone counseling significantly increases abstinence rates compared with minimal or no counseling, with a point prevalence abstinence (PPA) rate of 12.7% reported at 6 months in a 2008 meta-analysis. Combined treatment leverages the strengths of individualized telephone counseling with the sustained support available around the clock via the Internet and is increasingly being offered to consumers. Approximately half of all telephone quitlines provide cessation services via the Internet, and numerous health plans and employers provide com-bined cessation treatment. As stated by Croyle, \"standalone quitlines are already a fading anachronism\" but evidence concerning combined treatment remains limited. One large observational study reported a 30-day abstinence rate of 21% at 6 months among 11 143 participants. Despite the widespread availability of combined Internet and telephone treatment for smoking cessation, to our knowledge there have been no randomized trials to evaluate its efficacy.\nEvaluating the effectiveness of Internet only and combined Internet and telephone interventions has major implications for research, practice, and policy. Market demand is driving provision of combined smoking cessation treatments without empirical evidence. If effective, Internet or combined Internet and telephone treatment could play a central role in the efficient implementation of tobacco control programs. This article presents the primary outcomes of the Quit Using Internet and Telephone Treatment (iQUITT) study, a large-scale, 3-arm randomized controlled trial that evaluated the comparative effectiveness of enhanced Internet (EI) and Internet in conjunction with proactive telephone counseling (EI񮽙P) against a basic Internet (BI) comparison condition. A priori hypotheses were that EI and EI񮽙P would produce higher quit rates compared with BI and that EI񮽙P would outperform EI.\n",

Described previously, active user interception sampling was used to recruit US adults who used the terms quit(ting) smoking, stop(ping) smoking, or smoking in a major Internet search engine and who clicked on a link to the cessation treatment Web site being evaluated (www.quitnet.com). Preliminary eligibility screening was conducted online. Eligibility criteria included US residence, current smoking of 5 or more cigarettes per day, age of 18 years or older, and no prior use of the QuitNet Web site as confirmed by the absence of a tracking cookie. Eligible participants provided online informed consent and personal contact information. A research assistant contacted participants by telephone to confirm eligibility, obtain informed consent, and administer the baseline assessment. Randomization was conducted via random numbers table and was stratified by sex and baseline motivation to quit. After randomization, participants were sent an automated e-mail that provided a copy of the study consent form, a Web link (URL) for their assigned Internet treatment condition (ie, BI or EI), and instructions regarding telephone counseling. A unique identifier embedded in the URL was used for tracking Web site use.\n",

QuitNet provides (1) advice to quit; (2) assistance insetting a quit date; (3) assessment of motivation, smoking history, demographics, and nicotine dependence; (4) individually tailored information based on the assessment; (5) problem solving and skills training content; (6) tailored assistance in using Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacotherapies; and (7) social support within its large online social network. The Web site remained consistent throughout the study period, with minimal upgrades or enhancements.\nParticipants randomized to EI񮽙P received 6-month free access to the full QuitNet Web site and proactive telephone counseling from trained, experienced counselors using the evidencebased and field-tested protocol of National Jewish Health. National Jewish Health is a nonprofit academic medical center located in Denver, Colorado, that has provided telephone counseling services to state quit lines, health plans, and employer groups since 2002 as part of its suite of wellness products. Counselors who participated in this project were part of a larger call center quit-line operation at National Jewish Health and followed the same counseling and quality monitoring protocols. QuitNet and telephone counseling were seamlessly integrated to create a comprehensive program. Participants were offered 5 calls in a relapse-sensitive schedule, providing intensive support during the first 30 days after a quit attempt when smokers are at highest risk of relapse. The goals of each telephone contact were to establish a supportive working relationship with the participant and to provide information and assist the participant in skill building to prepare fora quit attempt or to prevent relapse after a quit attempt. Counselors also prompted and reinforced use of QuitNet during each call. Counselors had realtime access to summary data regarding a participant's engagement on QuitNet through a system that facilitated the reciprocal exchange of data between telephone counselors and the Web site. Utilization metrics available to counselors included the date and time of a participant's registration on QuitNet, number of visits, number of posts in the online community, number of buddies, date of last login, and the use status of the enhanced (ie, individually tailored content and social network) components of the Web site. Telephone counselors incorporated this information into the counseling process and made specific recommendations about use of the Web site based on an individual's history. Counselors also sent individually tailored e-mails to the participant after completion of the counseling call to reinforce important elements of the discussion.\nParticipants randomized to BI were given 6-month free access to a static, information-only comparison condition composed of the content on QuitNet. This content included general cessation information, cessation pharmacotherapy information and directions for use, a directory of national cessation programs, and a database of frequently asked questions accumulated during the 10-year lifespan of QuitNet. Where possible, the language, graphics, and formatting of QuitNet were retained in the BI condition for usability and credibility. To allow for the examination of theory-driven hypotheses about mediators of treatment outcome, the interactive and individually tailored features of QuitNet and its social network were not available in BI.\n",

Participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale, 25,26 the Center for Epidemiologic StudiesDepression Scale, a modified version of the Partner Interaction Questionnaire, and the Social Network Index. Wherever possible, brief measures with known psychometric properties were selected to minimize respondent burden.\nFollow-up telephone assessments were completed at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after randomization by research assistants who were not masked to treatment assignment but did not provide any form of intervention. Participants were offered a $25 incentive for the completion of each survey and a $20 bonus for completing all 4 surveys. Participants unreachable by telephone were offered $15 for completing the survey via the Internet.\nThe study outcome metric was 30-day PPA determined at each follow-up in accordance with guidelines from the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco. Because no specific quit date was set in advance for study participants, the traditional conservative measure of continuous abstinence starting at a fixed quit date could not be used. However, we constructed a measure of sustained abstinence by combining 30-day multiple PPA reports at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. In these analyses, an individual was coded as an abstainer at a particular follow-up if he or she reported 30-day PPA at 3 months and at all subsequent time points up to the one being measured.

      "value": "This large-scale randomized trial evaluated Internet only and Internet plus telephone treatment for smoking cessation with encouraging short-and long-term cessation outcomes. The conservative measure of multiple PPA favored the EI񮽙P condition throughout the follow-up time points, likely reflecting initial, sustained gains. Significant betweengroup differences in the more commonly reported 30-day PPA rates during the first 12 months of the study were driven by superior outcomes in the EI񮽙P condition achieved early in the study period and maintained overtime. The addition of telephone counseling significantly increased cessation at 3 and 6 months over the 2 Internet conditions, although these differences were eventually attenuated at 18 months because of improvement in the BI and EI conditions. This study has several strengths. Designed largely as a pragmatic randomized trial, the study sought to maximize generalizability and real-world relevance while preserving internal validity. The use of a recruitment method to obtain a representative sample of the Internet population entirely in vivo, in this casein the moment of searching online for information about cessation, is innovative and demonstrates the feasibility of conducting large-scale randomized trials via the Internet. It is one of the few randomized trials of a widely disseminated Internet cessation intervention that will advance the science of Internet research. The study evaluates treatments as used in the real world, bridging what is often a critical gap between tightly controlled clinical research and the applicability of research findings in practice. The interventions are practical, can be scaled up to meet demand, and can be combined with other modalities of intervention provision (eg, primary care, managed care, and work site). These results extend and are consistent with the uncontrolled study of Internet and telephone treatment by Triage of smokers via the Internet may represent an effective and efficient way to provide combined cessation treatment to a large number of smokers, of whom approximately 20% can be expected to quit.\nIt is noteworthy that EI񮽙P treatment yielded relatively high quit rates early in the study (19% at 3 months), which were observed overtime. The integration of Internet and telephone programs may encourage greater immediate use and adherence to the information and support available through both modalities, may prevent early relapse by virtue of the timing of the counseling calls, and/or may provide direct social support that allows the counselor to tailor the intervention to the smoker's needs. The specific contribution of telephone counseling to the higher level of success of the combined program over each of the Internet-only interventions is unclear. It is possible that telephone counseling encouraged participants to set an early quit date and helped them sustain that early quit. Future WWW.ARCHINTERNMED.COM 50 studies will need to explore the optimum dose and format of adjuvant telephone treatment, as well as the mechanisms of action. The equivalent performance of EI and BI in this trial is consistent with other studies that found no significant differences between static and interactive Web sites. Identifying the active ingredients and optimal levels of intensity and tailoring of Internet cessation programs will bean important next step for the field. Future research should address this issue, perhaps with the use of adaptive research methods to ensure that interventions continue to improve as technology, consumer expectations, and scientific understanding advance.\nSeveral limitations should be noted. In designing this study, one might have considered other comparison or notreatment control conditions, especially in light of the unexpectedly high long-term quit rates in the information-only BI condition. However, the selection of an appropriate control condition raises pragmatic, ethical, and methodologic challenges that are not easy to resolve. Because participants were recruited online from within a search engine query, a basic information Web site (minimum treatment control) condition was deemed the best option. We considered using oradaptingtoanonlineformataself-helpmanualcommonly used as a minimal treatment control in smoking studies but determined that it would lack important qualities of usability, credibility, and interactivity that Internet users expect. The relatively high abstinence rates observed in the BI condition should be considered in the context of the recruit-  ment approach, which may have self-selected participants with unusually high motivation to quit. Although recruitment was conducted from a real-world sample of smokers on the Internet and data were collected on enrollees and nonenrollees, generalizabilityislimitedtothatsampleframe. As a related issue, it is possible that a bias against using a telephone intervention exists among individuals who turn to the Internet for smoking cessation assistance. The lower follow-up assessment rate among EI񮽙P participants at 3 months may have been owing to \"telephone fatigue\" among Internet users randomized to receive proactive telephone counseling. Telephone counseling was provided within the first 3 months of the study, which was the only assessment period for which higher loss to follow-up was observed. If present, this bias could have attenuated the effectiveness of the combined intervention. Future research will need to determine the extent to which recruitment modality (ie, Internet vs telephone) affects treatment preference, use, and outcomes.\nDespite these caveats, the potential public health significance (impact=reach񮽙efficacy ) of these findings is striking. Combining evidence-based cessation interventions such as Internet and telephone counseling could substantially accelerate cessation in the United States. The broad reach of the Internet to more than 10 million smokers seeking assistance each year 2 and the ubiquitous use of telephones, combinedwiththeefficacydemonstratedinthisstudy(7.7%-19.6% quit at 18 months), suggests that the potential population impact of this treatment approach is high.\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combined Internet and telephone treatment for smoking cessation in promoting sustained abstinence, as well as the effectiveness of BI and EI treatments, which accumulates during longer periods. Future studies will need to address the optimal duration, intensity, and active ingredients of treatment and assess the cost-effectiveness of these potentially widely disseminable interventions.
