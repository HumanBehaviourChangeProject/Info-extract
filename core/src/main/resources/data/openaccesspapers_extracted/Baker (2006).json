      "value": "Objective: Despite extremely high rates of smoking among individuals with psychotic disorders and the associated financial and health costs, few studies have investigated the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions among this group. The purpose of this study was to compare an integrated psychological and nicotine replacement therapy intervention for people with a psychotic disorder with routine care alone. Method: The authors recruited 298 regular smokers with a psychotic disorder residing in the community and randomly assigned them to a routine care comparison condition (N=151) or an eight-session , individually administered smoking cessation intervention (N=147), which consisted of nicotine replacement therapy , motivational interviewing, and cog-nitive behavior therapy. Outcome variables included continuous and point-prevalence abstinence rates, smoking reduction status, and changes in symptoms and functioning. Results: While there were no overall differences between the treatment group and comparison group in abstinence rates, a significantly higher proportion of smokers who completed all treatment sessions stopped smoking at each of the followup occasions (point-prevalence rates: 3 months, 30.0% versus 6.0%; 6 months, 18.6% versus 4.0%; and 12 months, 18.6% versus 6.6%). Smokers who completed all treatment sessions were also more likely to have achieved continuous abstinence at 3 months (21.4% versus 4.0%). There was a strong dose-response relationship between treatment session attendance and smoking reduction status, with one-half of those who completed the intervention program achieving a 50% or greater reduction in daily cigarette consumption across the follow-ups, relative to less than one-fifth of the comparison subjects. There was no evidence of any associated deterioration in symptoms or functioning. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the utility of a nicotine replacement therapy plus motivational interviewing/ cognitive behavior therapy smoking cessation intervention among individuals with a psychotic disorder. Further development of more efficacious interventions is required for those who do not respond to existing interventions.",

      "value": "Indi viduals with a psychotic disorder have consistently been shown to have very high rates of smoking, ranging from 70% to 88%, compared with approximately 50% for psychiatric disorders other than schizophrenia and 25% for the general population (4). Consequently, there is cause for concern because of the serious financial and health costs. It has been estimated that smokers with schizophrenia in the United States spend just over onethird of their weekly income on cigarettes (5). Smokers with psychiatric illnesses are less likely to stop smoking compared with individuals without psychiatric illnesses, probably because of higher levels of nicotine dependence (1). Smoking-related diseases may contribute to reductions in life expectancy, with the most common cause of death among people with schizophrenia being ischemic heart disease (6). Smokers with a psychotic disorder may smoke cigarettes in order to alleviate negative symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, or medication side effects in addition to smoking for many of the same reasons as smokers without a psychiatric illness (3). Paradoxically, smokers with a psychotic disorder have been reported to experience increased psychiatric symptoms, number of hospitalizations, and a need for higher medication doses.\nSeveral small trials have been conducted among smokers with schizophrenia, using combinations of either nicotine replacement therapy or bupropion with group interventions. Such interventions have been shown to be useful among smokers without a mental illness. However, available treatment trials for smokers with schizophrenia have been criticized on methodological grounds, including heterogeneous samples, small sample sizes, and lack of defined interventions and comparison groups, with cessation being achieved among very few participants and recommendations that future smok-BAKER, RICHMOND, HAILE, ET AL.\najp.psychiatryonline.org ing cessation interventions be evaluated using more rigorous methodology. There is also a need to assess smoking outcomes other than cessation (16).\nThe primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of individually administered motivational interviewing and cognitive behavior therapy plus nicotine replacement therapy on smoking cessation or reduction among individuals with a psychotic disorder and, second, to evaluate impact on psychiatric symptoms. It was hypothesized that a greater proportion of participants receiving motivational interviewing/cognitive behavior therapy plus nicotine replacement therapy would report smoking cessation or reduction, relative to a routine care control condition.\n",

Referrals were received from community health agencies (82.2%), inpatient psychiatric units (8.3%), and the Neuroscience Institute of Schizophrenia and Allied Disorders schizophrenia register (7.0%). Participants recruited through inpatient units were contacted 2 months postdischarge and invited to take part. Inclusion criteria were at least 18 years of age, smoking at least 15 cigarettes per day, and having an ICD-10 diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Participants were also required to express an interest in quitting smoking. Exclusion criteria were medical conditions that would preclude use of nicotine patches, being acutely psychotic (in which case, participants were reassessed 1 month postscreening), and having an acquired cognitive impairment.\nParticipants were informed that they would be randomly assigned to one of two conditions at the end of the initial assessment interview, which was achieved simply by asking them to draw a sealed envelope from a set of envelopes in which there was initially an equal distribution of treatment/control allocations at each site. Preferably, treatment sessions were conducted at the research center or at a nearby community clinic. However, if a participant was unable to attend these centers, sessions were conducted in the participant's home. The pretreatment assessment lasted 1.5 hours to 2 hours, while follow-up assessments lasted approximately 1 hour. This research was approved by relevant regional and university ethics committees in Sydney and Newcastle.

The assessment instruments used have been reported in another article (19) and are described only briefly in this study.\nDiagnostic measures. Diagnosis was determined using the Diagnostic Interview for Psychosis (20), a semistructured interview that confirms diagnosis using the Operational Criteria for Psychosis (21) and produces a diagnostic classification in accordance with ICD-10. The diagnostic categories obtained were later collapsed to match the psychosis categories reported in the Low Prevalence Disorders Study. In addition to providing a clinical diagnosis, the Diagnostic Interview for Psychosis gathered information on sociodemographic characteristics, premorbid adjustment, current symptoms and medication, social functioning, and service utilization. Antipsychotic medication was categorized according to \"atypical\" versus \"typical\" subtypes.\nSmoking outcome measures. The primary smoking outcome measures were continuous abstinence, point-prevalence abstinence, and smoking reduction status. These were all evaluated on an intention-to-treat or program effectiveness basis (23). Secondary smoking outcome analyses were based on the amount of treatment actually received, on a self-selection basis. Continuous abstinence refers to the proportion of participants who reported not smoking at all from the nominated quit date to the current assessment point (3, 6, or 12 months). Point-prevalence abstinence refers to the proportion of participants who had been abstinent for the 7  days preceding the follow-up assessment (16). Smoking reduction status was based on an assessment of whether or not participants had reduced their daily consumption of cigarettes by 50% or greater (including abstinence) relative to baseline (16), which maybe a particularly useful index among individuals with a psychotic disorder (11). Current abstinence from smoking was confirmed using a Micro 11 Smokerlyser, which assesses breath levels of carbon monoxide. A carbon monoxide level of <10 ppm signified that the participant was unlikely to have smoked in the last 8 hours. Nicotine dependence was measured by the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (24). Motivation to stop smoking was measured using the 11-item Readiness and Motivation to Quit Smoking Questionnaire, which provides an elaborated stages of readiness scale, ranging from 0 (precontemplation level 1: not contemplating quitting or cutting down) to 4 (preparation stage).\nMeasures of psychopathology and quality of life. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed using the 24-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (26), the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (28). General functioning was measured using the 12-item Short Form Survey, which produces mental component scores and physical health component scores, with lower scores indicating greater disability.\n",

James was surprised that he found the two 45-minute assessment sessions to be useful, although somewhat arduous. He commented, \"No one has ever asked me about smoking before ….I've never really thought about it.\" He was randomly allocated to the active treatment condition-a combination of cognitive behaviour therapy, motivational interviewing, and nicotine replacement therapy.\nMost of the initial sessions were spent discussing the ways in which James could best use nicotine replacement therapy and a range of behavioral techniques (e.g., coping with cravings, activity scheduling) to work toward his initial goal of total abstinence from cigarettes. James managed to remain abstinent between weeks 5 and 8, the longest time that he had been without a cigarette.

      "value": "The abstinence results are discussed first, followed by consideration of the smoking reduction findings and other potential intervention effects. One of the major findings was that, at all follow-up occasions, a significantly higher proportion of smokers with a psychotic disorder who completed all treatment sessions were currently abstinent, relative to those in the comparison group (pointprevalence rates: 3 months, 30.0% versus 6.0%; 6 months, 18.6% versus 4.0%; and 12 months, 18.6% versus 6.6%).\nSmokers who completed all treatment sessions were also more likely to have achieved continuous abstinence at 3 months (21.4% versus 4.0%). Moreover, no participants who attended fewer than five treatment sessions reported abstinence at any follow-up point, and very few participants attending five to seven sessions reported that they were abstinent. It appears that if smokers with a psychotic disorder complete all counseling sessions of a smoking cessation intervention (at which nicotine patches are also distributed), then they are more likely to stop smoking than smokers who do not complete those intervention sessions. A similar relationship was also reported in a small, uncontrolled study among smokers with schizophrenia (9). Therapy procedures to enhance completion of smoking cessation interventions (e.g., intervention completion contracts, other reinforcement contingencies) may enhance cessation rates in future studies.\nAs in other studies (e.g., 9, 10, 12), the overall cessation rate achieved at the end of treatment was modest and below that reported among smokers without a psychiatric illness (33). However, the lower cessation rates observed among the current sample are not unexpected, given that people with a chronic mental illness often have higher nicotine dependence (1), smoke more each day, and are less likely to have made previous attempts to stop smoking. From a methodological perspective, researchers seeking a higher degree of certainty in the assessment of current smoking abstinence may also require lower carbon monoxide thresholds (e.g., <3 ppm) (32).\nArguably, there was a more marked (treatment) dose-response relationship evident in the smoking reduction findings. Approximately one-half (41.4% to 57.1%) of the participants who completed the intervention reduced their smoking by at least 50% relative to baseline, compared with less than one-fifth of the comparison group (16.6% to 18.5%). This also extended to those who completed five to seven sessions (at least at 3 months). Given that reducing smoking does not appear to undermine future cessation efforts and may increase motivation, this is a potentially important finding. Ina recent review of published nicotine replacement therapy studies (primarily involving smokers not trying to quit), reported that 12% to 35% of participants receiving the active treatment reduced their daily cigarette consumption by 50% or greater (including abstainers), compared with 3% to 22% among participants in the control condition. The corresponding 12-month data from this study (31.3% versus 17.9%) are generally consistent with these findings, attesting to the value of targeting reduction, not just abstinence.\nThe high numbers of cigarettes smoked and levels of nicotine dependence reported in this study highlights the need for earlier smoking interventions among young people with mental health problems before they become heavy smokers. Current practice guidelines for psychiatrists recommend nicotine replacement therapy use even in early cessation attempts among individuals with psychiatric disorders, as they appear to have more withdrawal symptoms when they stop smoking (35). In our study, nicotine replacement therapy commencement was associated with a net reduction of five to eight cigarettes per day, suggesting that higher doses or a longer duration of nicotine replacement therapy use maybe necessary to obtain additional benefits. More generally, we should further explore the delivery and uptake of smoking interventions in primary care settings as well as any potential barriers (36). There is also an urgent need for further development of more efficacious interventions among smokers with severe mental illnesses who do not respond to interventions such as those evaluated in this study. Pharmacological approaches giving consideration to bupropion (e.g., 13) and Rimonabant, a cannabinoid receptor-1 antagonist (37), or different combinations of nicotine replacement therapy and motivational interviewing/cognitive behavior therapy interventions are worthy of further investigation. Although other studies have reported benefits of atypical versus typical antipsychotic medication on smoking (e.g., 10), our study did not find a significant benefit, and future studies should address this issue. It is also worth considering specific interventions for those starting on a regimen of clozapine, since this is known to decrease cravings (38).\nFurther study is needed to evaluate long-term nicotine replacement therapy use or extended cognitive behavior therapy interventions, allowing for resumption of treatment following relapse. It has also been suggested that smokers who reduce the number of cigarettes smoked should be informed that they should stop smoking but, if unable to do so in the short-term, that reducing smoking can be helpful in increasing their likelihood of quitting (11). Hughes (34) and McChargue and colleagues have suggested that reduction-focused smoking interventions among smokers with schizophrenia who do not wish to abstain from cigarettes should be evaluated, which also takes into account medication impacts and changes. The finding that individuals who continue smoking reported a significant decrease in motivation to stop smoking is not at odds with these recommendations by Hughes and McChargue et al. and probably reflects relatively high levels of BAKER, RICHMOND, HAILE, ET AL.\najp.psychiatryonline.org motivation at the point of recruitment, rather than negative expectations associated with ongoing study participation. There are also important financial and health benefits of smoking reduction among individuals with severe mental illnesses. Another important finding was that there was a significant improvement for the study groups as a whole on several mental health measures and no worsening of psychotic symptoms over time), which is consistent with other studies (e.g., 9, 10). Thus, the evidence suggests that participation in a smoking cessation study is not associated with the worsening of symptoms.\nOur study is currently the largest randomized controlled trial of a smoking intervention among individuals with a psychotic disorder. Since there was no control for therapy time, the possibility exists that the superior outcomes for the smoking intervention participants were because of additional therapist attention and support rather than the specific motivational interviewing/cognitive behavior therapy and nicotine replacement therapy intervention. However, this seems unlikely given the levels of dependence in this study and the evidence supporting the efficacy of combined nicotine replacement therapy and motivational interviewing/cognitive behavior therapy among nonpsychiatric populations. Given the ubiquitous nature of smoking among people with a psychotic disorder, the heavy costs of smoking among this group and the modest but encouraging findings, further randomized controlled trials examining more comprehensive interventions are probably required as well as assessments of the long-term outcomes of smoking cessation and reduction interventions.\n",
