      "value": "This study was conducted within the ongoing operations of the Oregon tobacco quitline (OTQL). Oregon used mass media campaigns, direct mailings to select populations (for example, Medicaid) and encouragement to physicians and health plans to recruit tobacco users to the OTQL. OTQL telephone counselling services were provided through a contract with Free & Clear, Inc, a Seattle based service provider. Eligible and consenting callers were randomly assigned to one of six interventions in a 3 (behavioural) 6 2 (NRT) design that compared brief, moderate and intensive telephone counselling, with or without an offer of free NRT patches.\nAbbreviations: ICER, incremental cost effectiveness ratios; NRT, nicotine replacement therapy; OTQL, Oregon tobacco quitline Screening and randomisation, registration staff described the study to quitline callers and assessed their interest and eligibility. Callers who were not eligible or interested in the study received standard OTQL services. Eligible callers were Oregon residents who were 18 years of age or older, spoke English or Spanish, smoked five or more cigarettes per day over the past six months and were planning to quit within the next month (or had quit within the preceding seven days). Callers were excluded if their health plan provided multisession telephone counselling through Free and Clear, Inc, as a covered benefit, or if they had medical conditions that would contraindicate patch use, including pregnancy, breast feeding, plans to become pregnant or a history of heart attack within the preceding month. Initially, callers with no health insurance were excluded because state policy provided free access to the multisession phone counselling with free NRT patches. When this state benefit ended midway through the recruitment period, uninsured callers became eligible for the study.\nEligible and interested callers next spoke to a tobacco intervention specialist who confirmed the caller's understanding of the study, answered questions and confirmed and documented informed consent. Consent included agreeing to randomisation and to considering offers of additional free services, such as phone support and/or NRT, without committing to actually use any services offered. Participants also consented to six-month and 12-month follow-up assessments. The Kaiser Permanente Northwest institutional review board and Public Health institutional review board for the Oregon Department of Health Services approved this study. Once the consent was confirmed, a computer algorithm randomly assigned participants.\n",

      "value": "A potential limitation is that our outcome relied on self reported abstinence. Although biochemical confirmation of abstinence is appropriate and necessary in some intervention settings, we and others 48-50 have argued against the need for biochemical validation in adult population based studies with no face to face contact. In these settings, the proportion of self reported quitters who test positive for cotinine is low and generally equal for treatment and control subjects; and the compliance with saliva collection procedures is poor (50-60% at best), especially across a large geographic area like Oregon.\nAnother potential limitation is that we did not obtain quit data beyond one year. Because differences in quit rates converged somewhat between six months and 12 months, it is possible that treatment effects would have diminished further by two years and beyond. Quit rates could also diverge, as has been seen in some studies, owing to repeated quit attempts in treatment groups. The reduced effect size between six months and 12 months also suggests that we need to study increasing booster sessions or repeating the intervention for those who relapse. A recent VA study suggests almost two thirds of relapsers are interested in trying again with behavioural and pharmacological support in the next 30 days. Another limitation is that we could not use a placebo NRT in this effectiveness trial of a politically sensitive statewide service and thus the NRT effect may, in part, be due to expectancy effects. Also, effect sizes may have been reduced by contamination if some controls acquired NRT on their own or if some subjects who were mailed NRT did not use it. From a policy perspective, however, state decision makers may careless about the mechanisms and more about the total impact (and costs) of policies that include an NRT offer versus no offer.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services in collaboration with the states has created a national network of quitlines 4 that can route anyone in the United States who calls a single number (1-800-QUITNOW) to their local state quitline. Health plans and employers are increasingly promoting similar services, sometimes coordinating closely with the state-level efforts. As a result, many physicians are routinely referring interested patients to quitlines for more extensive tobacco cessation support than can be offered during a short office visit. Our data show that offering follow-up counselling and medications through a quitline cost effectively increased patient satisfaction and doubled the overall quit rate.\n",

Power was adequate (0.80, alpha = 0.05) to detect a difference in abstinence of 0.04 (for example, 0.08 versus 0.12). We used multiple logistic regression to compare the moderate and intensive interventions to brief intervention, the NRT offer to no NRT offer and an NRT offer with the moderate compared to intensive arms.\nThe primary endpoint was smoking cessation at 12 months using traditional intent to treat assumptions. We also conducted two secondary analyses using multiple imputation procedures to account for missing outcome data. Firstly, we used baseline age, sex, income, education, presence of other smokers in the household and smoking rate to create five imputed datasets that were then averaged using the Solas program. Secondly, we used the same baseline variables to impute outcomes only for those with invalid phone or address information at follow-up and assumed that those who actively refused follow-up or did not respond to voicemail or mailed surveys (that is, passive refusals) were smoking.\n",

Labour costs included salary and benefits for interventionists, supervisory staff (including medical oversight) and administrative staff. Interventionist time included the actual time spent with individual participants, off-line preparation, training and other administrative functions. Contact time with participants included screening and enrolment, intervention delivery calls and ad hoc calls.

NRT costs were calculated as the programme price for actual shipments plus postage, as obtained from pharmacy records. Though Nicoderm CQ was provided free by GlaxoSmithKline, our analyses used the usual NRT costs paid by Free & Clear, Inc. We used ordinary least squares regression to calculate mean total programme costs and standard deviations for participants in each intervention. We calculated incremental costs per additional quit (that is, incremental cost effectiveness ratios, ICER) for each intervention compared to brief no NRT.

      "value": "This study is the largest to date of the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of alternative tobacco quitline services and policies. One-year abstinence rates increased when quitline callers were offered: (1) free NRT patches shipped by mail; and/ or (2) more intensive counselling with follow-up calls. These effects for NRT and follow-up counselling calls are consistent with meta-analyses for research conducted in other settings. Callers were also more satisfied with the quitline when they were offered NRT and/or additional follow-up counselling support. Customer satisfaction is important because of its relevance to word of mouth advertising and because policy makers often use this measure to evaluate the performance of quitlines.\nThe added costs of additional counselling and NRT were offset by their increased effectiveness and all conditions were highly cost effective enhancements to brief no NRT. While the cost per incremental quit was about $200 less for moderate no NRT ($1912) compared to either moderate NRT ($2109) or intensive NRT ($2112), moderate no NRT yielded a lower quit rate (14% vs 20% and 21%, respectively). Overall, the differences in incremental cost effectiveness across the five enhanced treatment conditions were modest and policy makers should focus more on other important attributes of the interventions, such as overall quit rates achieved, client satisfaction and their potential to attract more smokers to quitlines. Others have found that short term offers of NRT resulted in marked spikes in quitline calls. If this effect persists, states could choose to reduce advertising and instead provide more intensive and effective cessation services.\nThe literature generally supports a dose-response relation between level of service provision and successful quitting, but our primary intent to treat analyses found that the difference between the moderate (that is, two-call) and intensive (up to five-call) protocols was modest. This finding was probably due to the small difference in the number of calls actually completed in the moderate versus intensive conditions (1.7-2.0 vs 2.5-2.9 calls completed). This small difference is surprising because, with a similar quitline protocol in a non-research context, over 48 000 callers completed an average of 3.8 calls. Programme planners should do all they canto encourage callers to complete the full regimen of calls (for example, provide incentives and review counselling protocols to see if language needs to be changed to more strongly emphasise the importance of completing the entire protocol).\nOur response rate at 12 months was modest (69%), though fairly typical for low contact studies in community settings. Our primary outcome assumed that those with missing outcomes were still smoking. Because controversy remains about how to handle missing data in smoking trials, 37 46 we compared our primary intent to treat method to two different multiple imputation approaches. When we used multiple imputation methods to replace all missing outcomes, we found that the effect for the intensive intervention remained strong, the odds ratio for NRT was substantially reduced (though still significant) and the effect for the moderate intervention became nonsignificant. Multiple imputation strategies, however, are considered appropriate only when ''missingness'' is unrelated to outcome. This assumption maybe more appropriate for those with invalid phone and address information than for those who chose not to respond to repeated messages and mailings. When we imputed values only for those with invalid phone and address information and counted ''passive refusers'' as smokers, results were similar to our primary intent to treat approach.\nStrengths of this study include the large sample size and the opportunity to compare the effects of six alternative treatment regimens among the large portion (77%) of eligible OTQL callers who consented. The high recruitment rate and naturalistic context of the study increase the external validity and policy relevance of the findings. We tested the range of services typically offered by state quitlines and provide data by which to judge the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of alternative approaches.\n",
