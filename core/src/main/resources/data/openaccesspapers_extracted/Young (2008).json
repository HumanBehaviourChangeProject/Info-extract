      "value": "Australian general practice provides a unique setting for the provision of smoking cessation advice as over 80% of the population visits a general practitioner (GP) in any given year. An 'opportunistic' approach to cessation advice in which smoking is discussed with every patient, irrespective of the reason for the consultation, has the potential to reach a large number of smokers in the community. Despite compelling evidence for their impact and their unrivalled credibility as providers of health-related information, Australian GPs persistently exhibit low rates of detection of smokers and provision of evidence-based smoking cessation advice. Those few randomised trials conducted in Australia to redress this gap between evidence and practice provide no clear-cut conclusions that any strategy will work to increase GPs' systematic identification of smokers or enhance rates of advice.\nGPs themselves perceive lack of time to be one of the major impediments to their intervention with smokers. Smoking cessation advice, particularly those intensive and time-consuming interventions known to be especially effective in promoting quit attempts and achieving abstinence, could perhaps be delegated to and delivered by a nurse. A recent meta-analysis of 30 trials of nurse-delivered cessation advice found a modest overall positive effect when compared with controls or usual care (OR 1.47, 95%CI: 1.29-1.68). A subgroup analysis of those 11 studies involving smokers in primary care or out-patient settings indicated that smoking intervention by nurses almost doubled the odds of success (OR 1.90, 95%CI 1.48-2.43). In all of these studies, smokers were required to attend at least one face-to-face session, either individually or as part of a group. While a component of some interventions, telephone counselling was used only as an adjunct to face-to-face counselling and was not offered as a convenient medium for advice.\nCessation counselling that is delivered entirely by telephone holds considerable promise as a relatively inexpensive means to deliver individual advice that also can be flexible and tailored to individual needs. Telephone counselling has been shown to increase quit rates significantly compared with minimal or usual care when provided 'reactively' in response to a smoker's contact with a quitline or as an adjunct to hospital-initiated programs and has been recommended by several national guidelines for tobacco control.\nA recent Cochrane Review of 29 controlled trials of 'proactive' telephone counselling reported only a modest overall benefit however. A subgroup analysis of 19 studies found that proactive telephone cessation advice had minimal impact when provided to smokers who were recruited irrespective of their current intention to quit. Only three studies in this group involved recruitment of patients through primary care. The only study that recruited smokers opportunistically did not find any additional benefit from telephone followup used to reinforce physician advice, regardless of the intensity of that advice.\nThus, there remains a paucity of rigorous scientific evidence for or against opportunistic referral of smokers for telephone-delivered smoking cessation advice. As practice nurses area rarity in Australian general practice, assessment of the acceptability to patients of referral to a nurse for health promotion advice is particularly important. In response, we designed this randomised trial to determine acceptability and the effectiveness of this approach to improve quit rates and shifts in stage-of-change in smokers after six and twelvemonths. We also investigated the characteristics of smokers who consented to and completed this intervention.\n",

Our telephone-delivered intervention, based on the '5As' approach, was structured using an explicit protocol to ensure consistency. During the first call, smoking history, nicotine dependence and previous quit attempts were assessed. Smokers then were asked if they were willing to make a quit attempt. Those who were not ready to do so received a motivational intervention based on the '5Rs' to assist their progression along the 'stage-of-change' continuum. Smokers who were ready to make a quit attempt were assisted to set a specific quit date and to plan their quit attempt. The nurse also mailed them a quit kit.\nUnless contra-indicated, these smokers were encouraged to purchase nicotine replacement therapy (available in Australia without a doctor's prescription) to manage nicotine withdrawal. Smokers who set a quit date were telephoned again on the specified quit day, then one week and three weeks after the quit date. During these three calls, participants were congratulated if they had quit, were encouraged to maintain quitting and assisted in resolving any problems arising. Relapsing smokers received motivation advice and were encouraged to 'reframe' relapse as a learning experience for future cessation.\n",

      "value": "The impact of any intervention is predicated not only upon its efficacy but also its reach and uptake among the target population. Despite designing a smoking cessation intervention that was based on the best available scientific evidence, this randomised trial failed to demonstrate significant improvement in smokers' cessation rates or intention to quit smoking when the intervention was offered opportunistically for patients attending routine consultations in general practice. Among smokers in the intervention group, less than half accepted the offer of referral for telephone-based assistance from a nurse. Only one-third persisted with the intervention.\nThere is a considerable body of literature that has identified specific smoking cessation strategies that clinicians should use in order to maximise the efficacy of their smoking cessation advice. Thus, the challenge for tobacco control research is not so much to determine which specific strategies to use, but rather how this knowledge can be implemented to assist the greatest number of smokers in the community. Identification of, and intervention with, smokers attending general practice is as yet an underutilised strategy both in Australia and elsewhere. An intervention that capitalises on the reach of general practice to identify smokers but which delegates the time consuming counselling required to another health profession would seem ideal in theory. Regrettably, this was not confirmed. Our results also are consistent with those of the trial undertaken by Ockene and colleagues more than a decade ago in the United States that failed to demonstrate any benefit of telephone counselling as an adjunct to opportunistic physician advice.\nPrevious studies that have shown positive benefits from telephone cessation counselling have predominantly reflected the results that can be achieved with more motivated smokers who actively are seeking such advice through a helpline or who have been deemed eligible to be offered the intervention on the basis of their current  *not evaluable for patients with missing data for baseline stage of change * intervention group (intervention or control) X level of subgroup intention to quit. In contrast, the aim of the present study was to provide an intervention for any smoker, regardless of their current quit intentions, so as to move all smokers along the stage-of-change continuum towards complete cessation. It was hypothesised that as a number of unsuccessful attempts usually are needed before a person successfully quits, any improvement in intention to quit would signify a measure of success that could improve the chances of successful cessation in the future. While stage of change as measured in this study may not accurately predict future smoking status, it was disappointing that the intervention had no measurable impact on smokers' stated intentions, even in the short term.\nOne explanation for the lack of demonstrable benefit in this trial was the lower than anticipated acceptance of the intervention by smokers. Only 45% of those offered referral accepted even the first call by the nurse, and only onethird of the intervention group completed all four calls of the intervention. While smokers who were more motivated to quit were significantly more likely to accept and complete the intervention, motivated smokers were no more likely to actually quit than similarly motivated smokers in the control group as the intervention was equally ineffective regardless of patients' baseline stage of change. Among those smokers who completed the intervention, six and twelvemonth quit rates of 16% and 13% were achieved but the absence of a comparable control group precludes interpretation of these findings as a measure of intervention effectiveness. Future studies could investigate the impact of the intervention among the subgroup of more motivated smokers attending general practice.\nPatients in the control group received 'usual care' from their GP. Based on previous research that consistently has demonstrated minimal smoking cessation advice from GPs to smokers during routine consultations, it is probable that control group patients received, at best, a recommendation to stop smoking and the provision of a 'Quit Kit' to take home. Unfortunately it was not possible to monitor consultations directly as this study was undertaken in non-academic family practices where a requirement to tape consultations would likely have considerably reduced GPs' willingness to take part in the trial. If GPs had inadvertently 'compensated' for patients being allocated to the control group by providing a greater level of advice to these individuals, this could also go someway towards explaining the lack of apparent benefit of the nursing intervention. However, there was no difference between the intervention and control groups in patients' recall of smoking cessation advice in subsequent consultations so it does not appear that GPs differentially provided greater followup about smoking cessation for those in the control group.\nWe acknowledge a number of other limitations to this study. Given the lower than expected uptake of the intervention, statistical power was compromised but our data can be used in future meta-analyses. A much larger study is needed to provide a definitive assessment of this intervention. Given the low rates of acceptance of the intervention among smokers however, future studies also ought focus on the identification and provision of intensive support for the subgroup who are motivated to quit. Additional strategies are needed to motivate those smokers who are not yet ready to make a quit attempt. The assumption that all those lost to followup were continuing smokers is plausible but could have biased the results towards a null finding. We acknowledge considerable debate about the advantages and disadvantages of cotinine validation of self-reported smoking status. Yet a requirement for cotinine validation would likely have further increased loss to followup, with little gain in measurement accuracy.\n",
