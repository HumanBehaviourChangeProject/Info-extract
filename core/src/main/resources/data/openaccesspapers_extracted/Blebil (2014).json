      "value": "Background: Studies allover the world reported that smoking relapses occur during the first two weeks after a quit date. The current study aimed to assess the impact of the additional phone calls counselling during the first month on the abstinence rate at 3 and 6 months after quit date among smokers in Penang, Malaysia. Methods: The study was conducted at Quit Smoking Clinic of two major hospitals in Penang, Malaysia. All the eligible smokers who attended the clinics between February 1 stand October 31 st 2012 were invited. Participants were randomly assigned by using urn design method either to receive the usual care that followed in the clinics (control) or the usual care procedure plus extra counselling sessions through phone calls during the first month of quit attempt (intervention). Results: Participants in our cohort smoked about 14 cigarettes per day on average (mean = 13.78 ± 7.0). At 3 months, control group was less likely to quit smoking compared to intervention group (36.9% vs. 46.7%, verified smoking status) but this did not reach statistical significance (OR = 0.669; 95% CI = 0.395-1.133, P = 0.86). However, at 6 months, 71.7% of the intervention group were successfully quit smoking (bio-chemically verified) compared to 48.6% of the control group (P < 0.001). The control group were significantly less likely to quit smoking (OR = 0.375; 95% CI = 0.217-0.645, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Smoking cessation intervention consisting of phone calls counselling delivered during the first month of quit attempt revealed significantly higher abstinence rates compared with a standard care approach. Therefore, the additional counselling in the first few weeks after stop smoking is a promising treatment strategy that should be evaluated further.",

      "value": "There is no specific method or technique that has been confirmed as the best way to improve the abstinence rates of smoking. Numerous studies have tried to find the most effective and feasible method to assist and support smokers who want to quit smoking. In Malaysia, the majority (80.3%) of tobacco users tried to stop smoking without assistance. Furthermore, 9% of them used pharmacotherapy followed by counselling (4.4%) or quitline and others (7.6%) (Such as traditional medicines, switching to smokeless tobacco).\nSeveral studies reported that up to 70% of the tobacco users who quit smoking cigarettes had relapsed within the first two weeks of their quit dates. Thus, the initial two weeks are considered a window period prior to the achievement of long-term abstinence. After this critical era, curves of relapse of the treatment and control groups in intervention studies become parallel.\nThus, the prevention of relapse in the first two weeks might enhance the probability of successful long-term abstinence.\nThe majority of smokers prefer to cease using tobacco products, avoiding attendance at counselling sessions or group programmes (person-to-person contact). Counselling through phone calls has been paid more attention as an alternative for the delivery of services. There are numerous potential benefits of smoking cessation telephone counselling including the ease of use, whenever required and wherever the tobacco user is located; cost-effective delivery and scalability to a large number of people, regardless of location; the ability to tailor messages to key user characteristics (such as age, sex, ethnicity); providing a content that can distract the smoker from craving; and linking the smokers with others for social support.\nTherefore, in order to provide a more comfortable and feasible intervention and to assess additional counselling sessions during the first month after the quit date, it has been interesting to evaluate the effectiveness of this type of counselling using telephone calls. The results will help to explore and assess the benefits of using loading counselling sessions using telephone calls to support people who want to quit, and to compare this method with the usual provisions in Malaysian healthcare settings regarding the abstinence rate.\n",

      "value": "After the assessment for the eligibility, the participants were randomised and allocated to the specific groups. All participants during the baseline visit were interviewed by the expert counsellor. The counsellor interviewed them using intense counselling approach for about 20-30 minutes. The study participants were asked about their socio-demographic (age, sex, race, marital status, education level), medical background, and smoking-related information history (age started to smoke, number of cigarettes smoked per day, previous quit attempt), the level of nicotine dependence using the Malay version of Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND-M) and their confidence in quitting by self-reported efficacy (i.e. how they rate their chance of stopping smoking permanently at the current attempt) using a 5-point Likert scale (very high, high, neutral, low and very low), and exhaled carbon-monoxide (CO) level (higher intensity counselling refers to an intervention that involves extended contact between the patient and the clinician of more than 10 minutes). The exhaled CO level was measured by using the Smokerlyzer MicroCO® meter (Micro Medical Limited Company). The concentration of CO from the breath was measured, with a cut-off point CO level of ≥ 7 part per million (ppm) as indicative of smoking.\nThe smokers learnt about the negative effects of smoking and their effect on health as well as the positive effect from stopping it. In addition, all participants received free nicotine gum supplements for 2 weeks only according to general regulations and policies followed in the Ministry of Health Malaysia. They learnt how to use NRT, gained knowledge about smoking withdrawal symptoms and how to control themselves against any of these withdrawal symptoms or cravings for cigarette smoking, especially during the first two weeks after quitting. Moreover, each smoker received self-help materials in the form of brochures and booklets on stopping smoking in Malay and Chinese languages to help him/her review what he/she has learnt from the counsellor. These materials have been developed and published by the Health Education Division, Ministry of Health Malaysia, and reported the harmful effects and health consequences of smoking. In addition, one of the booklets displays the objectives of the Quit Smoking Clinic, including clinic processes to achieve its goals and other activities.\nThe participants, who randomised to the control group, received the usual care which is recommended by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia. According to Malaysian clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of tobacco use and dependence the counsellor conduct individual counselling for the smoker who wants to quit by providing him all the support and advices as well as self-help materials (see). During the counselling session, which last for 20-30 minutes, the counsellor emphasised and reviewed problem solving and training procedures for each participants to support quitting.\nFor those in the usual care group, during the first month of the study, the participants attended the Quit Smoking Clinic four times with a gap of one week between each visit. In the second month, the participants were asked to attend the clinic once every two weeks (totally 2 visits per month) and received an extra phone call one week after each visit (totally 2 phone calls per month). Furthermore, during the third month, participants received two phone calls and were asked to attend the clinic at the end of the month.\nIn the intervention group, the smokers received the same care procedure, except that they received an extra proactive phone call each week besides attending the clinic only in the first month (i.e., four visits + extra four phone calls). The procedure for the other two months was the same as for the control group.\nDuring the extra phone call counselling sessions, the counsellor encouraged smokers to endure with their attempt to quit and concentrated on their success so far. He provided them information about the harmful effects of smoking and provided them positive feedback and emphasised the benefits of stop smoking. He encouraged the participants to cease the usage of cigarettes, lighters, and ashtrays, and to avoid any environment where they would usually smoke. Furthermore, the counsellor prompted the smokers to identify the obstacles and the difficulties of stop smoking and strategy how to overcome them. The counsellor talked for about 10-15 minutes with every participant in each proactive extra phone call.\nThe main objective for the study was determining the self-reported point-prevalence abstinence (the previous 4 weeks) verified by exhaled CO level at 3 and 6 months follow-up points. At the end of the third month, the tobacco users were asked about their smoking status and were asked to attend the Quit Smoking Clinic again after 3 months (6 months from the baseline visit) to assess smoking status (4 weeks-point prevalence abstinence). Participants who chose not to attend the visit at the end of the third month or the visit at the end of the sixth month were considered smokers at that point (at the end of three month, 7 participants in control group and 3 participants in intervention were lost to follow-up. While at the 6-month follow-up point, 13 in the control group and 5 in the intervention group were lost). The outcomes data was collected by another research member not connected with counselling and the data analysis.\n",

The continuous variables were shown as mean ± standard deviation, while the frequencies and proportions were used in order to describe the categorical variables.

These nonparametric statistical tests were also performed to compare smoking abstinence rates (4 weeks point prevalence abstinence) between the two groups at 3-and 6-month follow-up points. In addition, binary logistic regression was employed to predict the impact of the extra phone calls (the integrated intervention) on the smoking cessation outcomes. The effectiveness of additional counselling in the first month of the quit attempt compared with the usual care on the prevalence of smoking abstinence was assessed through odds ratio (OR), and binary logistic regression was used to control the effect of the confounder.\n",

Cigarette smoking is tremendously rare among Malaysian females. Furthermore, the report of the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) in Malaysia reported that 22.9% of individuals aged 15 years or older (43.6% of males and 1% of females) were current smokers of cigarettes including manufactured, hand-rolled, or kreteks. Numerous studies reported that while cigarettes smoking remains acceptable for males, smoking by women is not socially sanctioned in Malaysia and other Asian countries in general. This suggests that quitting for female smokers is unlikely because they did not reveal the truth about their smoking status; hence the study was dominated by men.\nThe majority of the study participants had a history chronic disease (such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus).\n",

Out of them, 68% had been asked by their healthcare providers if they smoked and about 53% had been recommended to stop smoking by their clinicians.

      "value": "Finding from the current study demonstrated that selfreported point prevalence abstinence in the intervention arm was significantly higher than those in the control arm at 3 and 6 months. However, a biochemically-verified abstinence rate among the participants experiencing loading counselling through phone calls was higher in the subjects of the intervention group (74.2% versus 51.4%) and this was statistically significance at the end of 6 months only after the quit date (P < 0.001). Despite the believed objectivity of the CO biochemical measure, it does not provide a gold standard nor is it a perfect of accuracy in assessing smoking status. Since smoking by-products have short half-life in the body, the biochemical assessment of smoking status using Smokerlyzer is verified for the time only near the specimen collection (i.e., 24-48 hours). However, some participants didn't pass the biochemical assessment at the end of 3 and 6 months and therefore were considered smoker. This suggests that smoking validation using CO as a chemical biomarker resulted in the evaluation and the conformation of the self-report accuracy. In addition, the subjects in the intervention group were more likely to be abstinent (using verified 4-week point prevalence abstinence) at the end of three and six months. However, it was statistically significant at the end 6 months (OR = 1.644, 95% CI = 1.222 -2.212). Our finding suggesting that more intensive counselling during the critical period of quitting attempt (i.e. during the first month) could have a beneficial impact on long term. Similarly, a study was conducted in the United States, where people living with HIV/AIDS were randomised either to usual smoking cessation treatment or to a cellphone intervention. In the intervention group, the phone calls spanned a period of 3 months but were front loaded such that the majority of the phone calls were near the time of the scheduled quit date. At the end of third months, the patients in the intervention group were 4.3 (95% CI = 1.9 -9.8) times more likely to quit smoking (7-day point prevalence abstinence) compared with the usual care participants. Another study that compared the efficacy of front loaded versus weekly behavioural smoking cessation used a counselling schedule to increase the likelihood of successful early abstinence and subsequent long-term abstinence among 278 adult tobacco users. At the end of 12 months postquitting, intervention participants were more likely to be abstinent when compared with the participants in the weekly counselling schedule with regard to continuous abstinence, 7 or more consecutive days nor for 7 or more consecutive episodes, and point prevalence abstinence. However, it was significant only when continuous abstinence was used (11.7% vs. 6.3%, P = 0.007).\nAnother study reported that the strength of motivation to quit smoking, but not dependence, predicted success at abstinence. This raises the possibility that in countries such as Malaysia that are at an earlier stage in the \"tobacco epidemic\" motivation plays a vital role in success at quitting than dependence. This could happen if there are still large numbers of tobacco users who find it relatively easy to quit.\nA potential limitation of the current study is the relatively small sample size (the supposed target sample size 296 subjects, while the collected sample size was 231 subjects). However, by using the urn design randomisation, this problem was resolved to ensure randomisation between groups. Another limitation is that 96% of the recruited participants were males. Therefore, the generalizability of our results to their counterpart females might be compromised. Applying a single biomarker for the verification of the smoking status might result in misclassification and using an analytical method involved two or more biomarker (cotinine in plasma, saliva, or urine; thiocyanate in plasma or saliva; and CO in expired air) to distinguish objectively between smokers and non-smokers is recommended. However, collection of sample involves more contact with participants than usual in field studies may result in increased refusal. Due to this and financial restriction, only exhaled CO level was used for the biochemical assessment. Moreover, researches demonstrated that spouses impact each other behaviours. Since the smoking rate in Malaysian women is low and the majority of our cohort was male, this may affect the decision to quit smoking of their male spouse. Other external factors may influence the subject's decision to quit smoking such as the increasing cost of living, price of goods including cigarettes, and others. These factors might contribute to the difference observed in the abstinent rate between the 3 rd and 6 th month followup period, however we cannot fully understand the effect of these factors from the current data.\n",
