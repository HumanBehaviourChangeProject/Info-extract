Methods In 2005, all 61 general practitioners (GPs) in four municipalities in Copenhagen, Denmark, were invited to participate. Twenty-four GPs accepted and were cluster randomized to one of three groups: Group A, referral to group-based SC counselling (national model), n ¼ 10; Group B, referral to internet-based SC programme (newly developed), n ¼ 8; or Group C, no referral ('do as usual'), n ¼ 6. A total of 1518/ 1914 smokers were included, and 760 returned a questionnaire at 1-year follow-up. Results The participating GPs reported significantly more SC counselling than GPs who refused participation (P ¼ 0.04). Self-reported point abstinence was 6.7% (40/600), 5.9% (28/476) and 5.7% (25/442) in Groups A, B and C, respectively. Only 40 smokers attended group-based SC counselling, and 75 logged in at the internet-based SC programme. In cluster analyses, we found no significant additional effect of referral to group-based (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.6-1.8) or internet-based SC programmes (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.6-1.4). Conclusions We found no additional effect on cessation rates of GPs' referring to group-based SC counselling or internet-based SC programme. This finding might, to some degree, be explained by the short time used by the GPs on SC counselling and the selection of the participating doctors.",

      "value": "General practitioners (GPs) have repeated contact with the majority of the population. There is evidence that short smoking cessation (SC) advice given by a doctor is an efficient way to help smokers to quit and a more intensive SC intervention in a general practice increases the quit rates. The GPs have a relationship of confidence with their patients, and knowledge of the smoker's health that might be a motivational factor for the patient to quit. Therefore, in the clinical guidelines from the Danish National Board of Health, it is implemented that GPs shall identify systematically all smokers in their practice and give relevant SC assistance to all smokers motivated to quit. However, only 38% of the smokers in the Capital Region of Denmark 2 stated that they have been advised, within the last year, by their GP to quit smoking, which is comparable with other countries. Several reviews state that even though some GPs work hard to assist their patients to quit, there are large variations in counselling and room for improvements of SC intervention in general practice. A recent study showed that GPs referring smokers to an evidence-based quit-line service results in increased cessation. Also, it is well-documented that group-based SC counselling is efficient in helping people to quit. The Danish national model for group-based SC counselling has showed stable quit rates 16% after 1 year and has proved to be very cost-effective. However, about one in three Danish GPs state that possibilities for referral to other SC activities are insufficient. Studies suggest that education and knowledge-sharing benefits can be achieved through computer-based education methodologies, but there is still limited evidence of the outcome. Thus, routinely referring to group-based SC counselling or internet-based SC programmes could bean effective and acceptable way of intensifying SC intervention in general practice and of relevance for public health. However, little is known about acceptance and effectiveness of referral to these SC alternatives.\nThe objective of this study was to test if GPs routinely refer to either group-based SC counselling or an internetbased SC programme, would this practice result in higher SC rates after 1 year than usual in-clinic SC advice given by GPs.\nPrimary outcome was self-reported point abstinence at 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were: validated abstinence and smokers' and GPs' attitude to SC in general practice. The target subjects were all daily smokers attending general practice.\n",

It is free for all citizens to consult a GP (national health insurance paid by taxes). Since 2006, GPs have been paid for life-style consultations (individual counselling on, for example, SC, healthier diet and/or increased physical activity).\nThe study was designed by the request of general practice and designed to reflect 'real life' as much as possible. It was a demand from general practice that the intervention should be very easy to implement in a daily routine and not put the GPs under obligation of time-consuming registration or SC activities.\nIn the spring of 2005, all GPs (n ¼ 61) in four municipalities in the suburb of Copenhagen, Denmark, were requested by mail to participate. The Local Medical Society and the Committee of Multi Practice Studies strongly recommended participation. The four municipalities were chosen because they were geographically close to the Research Centre for Prevention and Health, where the group-based SC counselling (see below) took place. The doctors were informed that the extra workload during the study would below. The extra workload for the nurse or secretary was: registering all patients (smokers and non-smokers) at daily basis, asking about smoking status and registering all daily smokers, asking smokers to participate in the study and to complete a questionnaire. For the doctors in the referral groups, the extra work was: completing questionnaires (see below) and having a brief talk with every smoker. The doctors in the control group should do the same, except that they did not have to talk about smoking with all smokers.\nThe study was approved by the Copenhagen County Ethical Committee.

      "value": "The smoking prevalence in this trial was 17%, compared with 25% in a national sample the same year, and much lower than the smoking prevalence, 36%, found at the same time in a local large population-based study. There might be several reasons for these findings. First, this might be a registration problem, e.g. the doctor/nurse has forgotten to ask about smoking status. Second, it might be a selection problem, e.g. the GPs have been giving sufficient SC counselling for years and their patients had already quit smoking, or the reluctant smokers had chosen another, less 'SC aggressive' GP. Finally, it could be due to under-reporting. Some of the smokers might want to conceal their smoking for their doctor.\nIn Group A, the GPs estimated that 3 out of 10 expressed interest in participation in the group-based SC programme and additionally 1 out of 3 showed possible interest. The GPs in Group B registered that 6 out of 10 smokers expressed interest in trying the internet-based SC. However, only about one out of four of the smokers who expressed interest to take advantage of the assistance to quit signed for an SC group or logged in at the internet programme. A possible explanation could be that the smokers wanted to leave an impression of motivation to quit, avoiding a confrontation with their GP. This is not very probable, as more than half of the smokers also reported high wish to quit in the questionnaires. Alternatively, the smokers never managed to contact the SC counsellor or login on the internet. If the reason is forgetfulness or busyness, it might help if a nurse/secretary routinely signed the smoker in fora cessation group before he/she left the practice. In the Danish nationwide survey, one out of three GPs stated that they had their nurse/secretary involved in SC activities. Another explanation maybe that motivation to quit is not a stable condition. One day the smoker maybe worried about the damage on health and seriously consider quitting, and on the next day he/she maybe partying with smoking friends and has forgotten all about quitting.\nA recent Australian study provided evidence that GPs referring smokers to an evidence-based quit-line service resulted in increased cessation. The benefit was largely due to patients in the referral condition receiving more external help than those in the in-practice condition. In our study, baseline smokers who accepted external help and attended the SC groups had high abstinence rates at 1 year, 23%. Also, abstinence rates were a little higher in the group referred to group-based SC counselling. However, the low number of patients who accepted the offer given resulted in no significant additional effect of referral to group-based SC counselling.\nThe GPs were instructed to talk freely and briefly. It can be argued that the variation in the length and content of the conversations makes the 'quit smoking message' too diverse. It was not apart of the study to educate the doctors in how to talk about smoking, but this is of course important. Most GPs, including those in the control group, spent only a few minutes talking about smoking with their patients and had, on average, only two consultations a day with smokers, so there seems to be potential for improvement.\nA recent English study found that a brief training session can significantly increase GPs referral to SC services. Another randomized study found that proactively identifying smokers, and referring them to a cessation service, significantly increased contacts with cessation services and the number of quit attempts. A significant effect on long-term cessation rates was not detected, but the study was not powered to detect the difference.\n",

Also, it is probable that we underestimate the number of ex-smokers due to the low follow-up rate. However, this is due for all three groups and should not affect the result.\nAccording to power calculations, the number of smokers included in Group C was a little low, which may slightly have reduced the study's ability to detect a significant difference between the referral and the non-referral groups.\n",
