      "value": "The outcome data suggest that nortriptyline is a useful adjunct to smoking cessation efforts. This is supported by the correlation between serum levels and abstinence status. That it reflects more than compliance is indicated by the sustained significance of nortriptyline dose when net capsules ingested for active and placebo treatment were entered into the statistical model. Although there were differences inside effects between the active and placebo groups, they were not perceived as sufficiently troublesome to cause a high dropout rate. In fact, the dropout rate for participants in the active drug group was less than that for participants in the the placebo group.\nIndustry-sponsored studies have garnered a Federal Drug Administration indication for bupropion. Yet nortriptyline, a generic drug, is less expensive. Contrary to hypotheses, there was not a differential abstinence effect for smokers with a history of MDD using nortriptyline. These findings parallel those reported by others using bupropion. These 2 antidepressant drugs have similar effects on smoking cessation; both have effects on noradrenergic transmission, although effects on other neurotransmitter systems may differ between the 2 drugs. Independent of diagnosis, nortriptyline seems to have alleviated the increases in poor mood that occurred the first few days after smoking cessation. This finding has implications for the use of antidepressants to ameliorate the negative mood that follows smoking cessation in nonclinically depressed patients, as well as for use of the drug for instances of poor mood that are not part of a diagnosable disorder. It could be argued that differences in rates of smoking cessation among the 4 experimental cells could have confounded the observed differences in mood between the active and placebo drug conditions. We did not collect smoking data on days 3, 5, and 98, so we cannot definitely refute this argument. However, the effects observed are not easily explainable by possible differences in cessation rates. Dysphoria decreased from baseline today 3 in participants in the nortriptyline treatment group and increased in participants in the placebo group. Increases in dysphoria are frequently noted after quitting smoking ; therefore, the observed differences between the drug conditions are not likely to be due to confounding by smoking quit rates.\nWe replicated the original findings that MDD history-positive participants are differentially helped by a 10-session CB intervention when it is compared with a 5-session HE intervention. These results contrast with alack of significant enhancement of outcome for MDD history-positive participants when therapeutic contact time was held equivalent in the control condition. Thus, increased psychotherapeutic contact may differentially benefit smokers with a depressive history. This interpretation of the data is further supported by the failure of the psychotherapeutic condition to differentially alter cessation-induced changes in mood.\nA history of MDD has predicted poor treatment outcome in some studies 6 but not others. Only a few reported sex differences, and lack of analysis for such differences may explain the inconsistencies in the literature. The results do not support the hypothesis that MDD history-positive participants would have a greater increase in negative affect after quitting smoking than MDD history-negative smokers. Indeed, while MDD historynegative smokers did show an increase in poor mood after quitting smoking, MDD history-positive smokers showed a nonsignificant decrease. These data are not consistent with earlier investigations. These earlier investigations are difficult to compare with the current study, because of lack of baseline data, 8 failure to include sub- *Data are given as the mean (SD) at baseline and day 3. POMS indicates Profile of Mood States; TMD, total mood disturbance.

Major depressive disorder history-positive participants showed decreased POMS-TMD scores for baseline today 3, but the magnitude of the decrease was not a significant predictor of smoking status (񮽙 2 1,65 = 2.26, P = .13).\njects who successfully quit, or small sample size. However, the failure of current data to agree with the existing literature, even though the literature is imperfect, is troubling, and the current findings should be considered tentative until replicated. Similarly, increase in the POMS-TMD scores from baseline to 3 days after the quit date predicted failure to maintain abstinence for MDD history-negative participants but not for MDD history-positive participants. For the latter participants, a greater decrease in poor mood from baseline today 3 was related to abstinence but not significantly so.\nThere are limitations to the study. First, the outcomes reported do not represent those that could be expected were nortriptyline to be used in atypical medical setting. Psychological intervention in this study provided more contact time and intensity than could be provided by most physicians. Second, this is a volunteer sample of participants who sought treatment and who were more motivated to change than the smokers encountered in physicians' practices. Third, most participants, independent of condition, were smoking at the 64-week follow-up.\n",
