      "value": "Objective-To examine the ability of a secondary prevention programme to improve the lifestyle in myocardial infarction patients aged 50-70 years. Design-Habitual physical activity, food habits, and smoking habits were assessed from questionnaires at admission to hospital and at the one year followup. Initially, all patients were invited to join an exercise programme and were informed about cardiovascular risk factors. Four weeks after discharge from the hospital, 87 patients were randomised to followup at the coronary prevention unit by a special trained nurse (the intervention group), and 81 to followup by their general practitioners (the usual care group). After randomisation, the intervention group was educated about the effects of smoking cessation, dietary management , and regular physical activity. The intervention group also participated in a physical training programme two to three times weekly for 10-12 weeks. Main results-89% of the patients referred to the intervention group improved their food habits compared with 62% of the patients referred to the usual care group (P = 0.008). Furthermore, 50% of the smokers referred to the intervention group stopped smoking compared to 29% in the usual care group (P = 0.09). Changes in physical activity did not differ between the groups. Conclusions-This secondary prevention programme based on a nurse rehabilita-tor was successful in improving food habits in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Initiating the smoking cessation programme during the hospital stay followed by repeated counselling during followup might have improved the results. The exercise programme had no advantage in supporting physical activity compared to usual care.",

The diagnosis was established by raised serum creatinine kinase and its subunit MB, plus characteristic chest pain or electrocardiographic changes, according to WHO standards.5\nDuring the first three weeks after discharge from the hospital, all patients were enrolled in a followup schedule including two visits at a nurse and one visit at a cardiologist. They were informed about coronary artery disease risk factors and the effect of lifestyle changes on the prognosis. During the same period all patients were invited to join an exercise programme led by a physiotherapist under supervision of a nurse from the rehabilitation team. At each occasion, the exercise programme included information about the positive effects of physical activity and 45 minutes of easy interval training.\nFour weeks after discharge from the hospital, patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to followup at the secondary prevention unit (the intervention group) or to usual care which included two to three visits to their general practitioners during the first year after the randomisation (the Influence ofcoronary nursing management followup on lifestyle after acute myocardial infarction usual care group). The figure provides details of the flowchart.\nPatients were excluded from randomisation in the case of unstable angina, that is, new chest pain at rest or ECG changes in the character of the angina, ST depression of more than 3 mm during an exercise test in two chest leads or more than 2 mm in two limb leads, or signs of congestive heart failure.\nIn the end, 168 patients out of a total of 273 were eligible for randomisation, made in groups of 20. An equal number of patients in each randomisation group was randomly allocated to the intervention group or to the usual care group.\n",

Dietary education was undertaken both with the individual patient and the spouse, and in a group session including other patients.

      "value": "In general, cardiac rehabilitation programmes offer education about the heart and risk factors for coronary artery disease. The reported effects of such programmes differ considerably. Some studies have reported positive results of formal patient education on behavioural factors, for example exercise, smoking cessation, coping, and resumption of sexual activity.6 The studies were small and differed in design as well as time of follow up.6-'0\nOther studies have reported no or minor effects of rather ambitious educational programmes. 11-13 Only a few have validated a nurse monitored secondary prevention programme. One study,'4 reported better return to work and a better smoking status with counselling sessions given by a nurse rehabilitator. In contrast to that study, another study'5 found no beneficial effects on the psychosocial outcome from a nurse rehabilitator intervention and suggested that special counselling programmes may not be useful.\nHowever, the present nurse monitored secondary prevention programme was successful in improving food habits as measured by questionnaire at the one year followup. Some earlier studies have also noticed positive effects of dietary education during the hospital stay'6 and when using a mail-out intervention without visits to a prevention unit. Influence of coronaty nursing managementfollow upon lifestyle after acute myocardial infarction\nThe present programme obtained 50% smoking cessation in the intervention group. One earlier study obtained 61% smoking cessation during one year followup after acute myocardial infarction. In that study the smoking cessation intervention was initiated already during the time in hospital and thereafter maintained primarily through telephone contact. Contrary to that study, we did not have a smoking cessation programme during the hospital stay. Our patients were informed about the effects of smoking as part of the general risk factor education.\nAnother study also used repeated telephone counselling monthly up to one year post discharge from hospital in order to persuade patients to stop smoking. At 12 months the cessation rate was 70%.19 Thus initiation of a smoking cessation programme during the hospital stay and repeated counselling during followup may improve the results.\nIn summary, after the initial education about coronary risk factors given to all patients, the extended prevention programme described in this study attained an additional effect on diet habits. Initiating the smoking cessation programme during the hospital stay, followed by repeated counselling during followup, might have improved the result. The exercise programme had no advantage in supporting physical activity compared to usual care.\n",
