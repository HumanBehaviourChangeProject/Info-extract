      "value": "IMPORTANCE Health care systems need effective models to manage chronic diseases like tobacco dependence across transitions in care. Hospitalizations provide opportunities for smokers to quit, but research suggests that hospital-delivered interventions are effective only if treatment continues after discharge. OBJECTIVE To determine whether an intervention to sustain tobacco treatment after hospital discharge increases smoking cessation rates compared with standard care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial compared sustained care (a postdischarge tobacco cessation intervention) with standard care among 397 hospitalized daily smokers (mean age, 53 years; 48% were males; 81% were non-Hispanic whites) who wanted to quit smoking after discharge and received a tobacco dependence intervention in the hospital; 92% of eligible patients and 44% of screened patients enrolled. The study was conducted from August 2010 through November 2012 at Massachusetts General Hospital. INTERVENTIONS Sustained care participants received automated interactive voice response telephone calls and their choice of free smoking cessation medication (any type approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) for up to 90 days. The automated telephone calls promoted cessation, provided medication management, and triaged smokers for additional counseling. Standard care participants received recommendations for postdischarge pharmacotherapy and counseling. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was biochemically confirmed past 7-day tobacco abstinence at 6-month follow-up after discharge from the hospital; secondary outcomes included self-reported tobacco abstinence. RESULTS Smokers randomly assigned to sustained care (n = 198) used more counseling and more pharmacotherapy at each follow-up assessment than those assigned to standard care (n = 199). Biochemically validated 7-day tobacco abstinence at 6 months was higher with sustained care (26%) than with standard care (15%) (relative risk [RR], 1.71 [95% CI, 1.14-2.56], P = .009; number needed to treat, 9.4 [95% CI, 5.4-35.5]). Using multiple imputation for missing outcomes, the RR for 7-day tobacco abstinence was 1.55 (95% CI, 1.03-2.21; P = .04). Sustained care also resulted in higher self-reported continuous abstinence rates for 6 months after discharge (27% vs 16% for standard care; RR, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.15-2.51]; P = .007). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hospitalized adult smokers who wanted to quit smoking, a postdischarge intervention providing automated telephone calls and free medication resulted in higher rates of smoking cessation at 6 months compared with a standard recommendation to use counseling and medication after discharge. These findings, if replicated, suggest an approach to help achieve sustained smoking cessation after a hospital stay.",

Adults aged 18 years or older who were admitted to MGH were eligible if they were current smokers (smoked ≥1 cigarette/day during the month before admission), received smoking cessation counseling in the hospital, stated that they planned to try to quit smoking after discharge, and agreed to accept a smoking cessation medication. Patients were excluded if they had no telephone; had an expected hospital stay of less than 24 hours; substance use in the past 12 months other than tobacco, alcohol, or marijuana, or were admitted for an alcohol or drug overdose; could not give informed consent or participate in counseling due to impaired mental status, cognitive impairment, or communication barrier; were admitted to the obstetric or psychiatric units; had an estimated life expectancy of less than 12 months; or had medical instability.\nAll MGH patients have their smoking status electronically documented at admission, generating a roster of hospitalized smokers accessed daily by counselors from the Tobacco Treatment Service who aim to visit every hospitalized smoker. The counselors ensure adequate management of withdrawal symptoms with NRT and offer to assist smokers who plan to \"stay quit\" after discharge. Counselors screened smokers for study eligibility and referred the smoker to research staff to confirm eligibility, obtain informed consent, conduct the baseline assessment, and assign the participant to a study group.\n",

      "value": "The sustained care condition had 2 components designed to reduce patient barriers to completing a full course of tobacco treatment after discharge. First, a 30-day supply of free tobacco cessation medication (any type approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) was provided at discharge and was refillable twice for up to 90 days of treatment. Medication was chosen by the patient and smoking counselor during the inpatient visit. Treatment could include single agents (nicotine patch, gum, lozenge, bupropion, or varenicline) or a combination of these. Second, 5 automated outbound interactive voice response telephone calls (at 2, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days after discharge) provided advice and support messages that prompted smokers to stay quit, encouraged proper use and adherence to cessation medication, offered medication refills, and triaged smokers to a return telephone call from a live counselor for additional support. The automated telephone script encouraged participants to request a callback from a counselor if they had low confidence in their ability to stay quit, had resumed smoking but still wanted to quit, needed a medication refill, had problems with a medication, or had stopped using any medication. A trained counselor made the return telephone calls using a standardized protocol. A fax sent to the primary care clinician of each patient informed him/her of the treatment program.\nStandard care provided smokers with a specific postdischarge medication recommendation and advice to calla free telephone quit line (1-800-QUIT-NOW). A note in the chart advised hospital physicians to prescribe the medication upon discharge.\n",

Race/ethnicity was assessed by patient self-report. Hospital records provided primary discharge diagnosis, length of stay, smoking cessation medication use in the hospital, and the counselor's recommendation for postdischarge tobacco cessation medication. Participants were called 1, 3, and 6 months after hospital discharge. A telephone interviewer collected data on tobacco use status and tobacco cessation treatment use. We defined tobacco cessation treatment to include any pharmacotherapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (including NRT, bupropion, or varenicline) or cessation counseling provided by a physician, nurse, MGH or community counselor, or state telephone quit line. Participants were reimbursed $20 per completed survey.\nThe primary outcome was biochemically validated 7-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence 6 months after discharge. Tobacco abstinence was defined as abstinence from any tobacco product including electronic cigarettes. To verify selfreported abstinence at 6 months, patients were asked to provide a mailed saliva sample for assay of cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, and reimbursed $50 for the sample. Participants using an NRT had an in-person measurement of expired air carbon monoxide. Self-reported abstinence was considered verified if saliva cotinine level was 10 ng/mL or lessor if the carbon monoxide level was less than 9 ppm. 17 Secondary smoking status outcomes were self-reported 7-day point prevalence and continuous abstinence at 1, 3, and 6 months postdischarge.\n",

The sample was increased to 400 without interim analysis to add statistical power. The analyses were performed using an intentto-treat approach and SAS statistical software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc). We compared the characteristics of the participants by group using 2-sample t tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and χ 2 tests. A 2-sided P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. According to the prespecified protocol, we conducted cross-sectional analyses at each follow-up point, comparing rates of tobacco treatment and cessation between study groups using χ 2 tests, and calculated the number needed to treat. We also conducted a longitudinal analysis using the generalized estimating equations technique that included data from all follow-up times to assess the overall effect of the intervention. Per the prespecified protocol, patients with missing outcomes at follow-up (including those who died) or whose self-reported abstinence was not biochemically validated were counted as smokers in the primary analysis. We conducted a sensitivity analysis using previously published methods to assess the relationship between alternate approaches to imputation and effect size. Multiple imputation for the missing primary outcome measure used age, sex, whether the patient had a smoking-related disease, and the smoking outcome at 3 months as predictors in a logistic regression model. The final inference was combined from 5 sets of imputed samples.\nWe explored the effect of the intervention in subgroups of participants defined post hoc by age (<55 years or ≥55 years), sex, race (non-Hispanic white vs other), number of cigarettes/ day (<10 or ≥10), discharge diagnosis (circulatory disease vs other smoking-related disease 1 vs other), hospital length of stay (<5 days or ≥5 days), NRT use during hospitalization, and depression symptoms (8-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score: <16 or ≥16). We tested the interaction between study group and each subgroup using Breslow-Day tests.\nWe prospectively tracked the direct costs of delivering sustained care exclusive of research costs. Costs included the interactive voice response service, up to 90 days of medication (using the price paid by our institution), mailing of medication refills, personnel time, and office space. Personnel time included time for database construction and management, counselor training, time spent offering the intervention, tracking of patients, managing medications during the hospital stay and postdischarge, and reaching out to and counseling patients postdischarge. The value of staff time was based on salary and fringe benefits. Office space, computer, and telephone cost was based on institutional charges. We calculated the incremental cost per quit and cost per patient of delivering sustained care compared with standard care from a health system perspective. We evaluated costs under 2 scenarios. In the first scenario, the hospital paid for all medications, reflecting how the trial was conducted. In the second scenario, we assumed the hospital could bill insurers for smoking cessation medications, which should be possible with nearuniversal coverage of smoking cessation medications under the Affordable Care Act.\n",

The intervention appeared to be effective across abroad range of smokers and provided high-value care at a relatively low cost. Hospitals could adopt this model to help meet the Joint Commission's tobacco cessation hospital quality standard. The intervention could also be incorporated into care delivery models that aim to improve population health by coordinating the care of smokers with other chronic diseases across transitions of care. The intervention used interactive voice response technology to automate telephone calls, providing an efficient, lowcost way to systematically maintain contact with smokers after hospital discharge. Ina previous study, we provided automated calls for 1 month after hospital discharge to all smokers, regardless of their intention to quit. It was feasible but did not increase smoking cessation rates. The current study focused the intervention on smokers who planned to quit, extended automated telephone calls for 3 months, and paired the telephone calls with smoking cessation medication provided at no cost to patients at discharge. It also expanded the scope of automated telephone calls to monitor and promote medication adherence and facilitate medication refills. Sustained care increased the use of both counseling and pharmacotherapy by smokers after discharge, which may have mediated the improved smoking cessation rates.\nInteractive voice response technology has been used in healthcare systems to assess postdischarge surgical outcomes and to deliver care to individuals with chronic diseases like diabetes. It has been a component of smoking interventions in ambulatory care and in the community. Our program was based on a Canadian model that offered tobacco cessation counseling by interactive voice response calls after discharge. That model improved 6-month continuous abstinence rates over baseline rates in a pre-post evaluation in 6 hospitals. Our program extends the Canadian model by offering medication at no cost to patients at discharge and by adding a medication adherence component to the interactive voice response system. Our study also used the stronger design of a randomized trial.\nPharmacotherapy was used after hospital discharge by most smokers in both study groups, probably because the inpatient smoking counselor encouraged NRT use in the hospital and made a postdischarge medication recommendation for all participants. 31 However, the sustained care program increased the duration of pharmacotherapy use after discharge. Sixty-one percent of smokers in the sustained care group used medication for 8 weeks or more of a 12-week course, whereas nearly half (48%) of smokers in the standard care group used medication for only 2 weeks or less. The longer treatment duration likely contributed to the 71% higher quit rate in the sustained care group. The magnitude of the improvement is at the higher end of the 50%-70% relative increase in cessation rates produced by NRT overall, probably reflecting good medication adherence, use of combination NRT over a single NRT product, and the concomitant use of counseling.\n",
