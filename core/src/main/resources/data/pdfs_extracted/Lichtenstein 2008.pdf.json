Participating households (n 5 1364) were randomized within a 2 3 2 design to evaluate the main effects of brief telephone counseling and a targeted video on smoking cessation and the establishment of new household smoking bans. Phone counseling was associated with cessation at 3-month follow-up but neither intervention led to 12-month or sustained cessation. While neither intervention had a significant effect on new bans, there were trends in the predicted direction and the combination of the two significantly increased new bans compared with no intervention. The presence of children in the household was associated with new bans. While few households had high levels of radon, such levels were associated with radon mitigation behaviors. Together with a previous study, these results suggest radon risk is a useful and inexpensive way to engage smoking households in risk reduction behaviors, especially the institution of household smoking bans.",

      "value": "Research and expert consensus panels continue to identify radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking. While high concentrations of radon are present in only 6-7% of homes in the United States, the far more numerous low readings have synergistic or submultiplicative effects for cigarette smokers, thereby greatly increasing the numbers of citizens or households at risk. Nonsmokers radon risk often is mitigated by frequent changes in their place of residence while smokers' elevated risk from the combination of radon and smoking moves with them.\nAs formal smoking prohibitions increase in public places and the workplace, the home remains an entrenched smoking area. Although home environmental tobacco smoke exposure (ETS) has declined significantly since 1992, 25% of homes with children in the United States contain ETS. The synergy of radon and smoking increases the risk for smokers-and possibly nonsmokers-in these households. The identification of novel opportunities for presenting risk information in costeffective ways to motivate smokers is now a priority, since most smokers have been exposed to nonsmoking messages in the media and through healthcare providers. Exposure to information about the synergistic risk of radon and smoking is one such motivating opportunity. For the great majority of households with smokers, smoking cessation or banning smoking in the home yields much greater risk reduction benefits than does structural mitigation to reduce radon concentrations. This is especially so for households testing below the action level (<4 pCi/l) for radon since it is difficult and expensive to reduce radon concentrations further. Even with a radon level of 2 pCi/l, there is a 15-fold difference in relative lung cancer risk between smokers and nonsmokers. Both studies in our research program emphasized the value of quitting smoking or reducing environmental tobacco smoke.\nIna prior study, we approached households about radon and smoking through a partnership with a local electric utility company. Households with radon levels below <4 pCi/l were randomized to either experimental intervention strategies or to receive standard Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) materials and compared on the dependent variables of quitting smoking and banning or restricting smoking in the home. The EPA guide and a specially developed pamphlet-intended to raise awareness of the radon-smoking synergy-yielded similar and nonsignificant outcomes at follow-up. However, brief telephone counseling (one or two short calls) led to significantly more new household smoking bans compared with a pamphlet only. The utility company recruitment strategy was successful in that ;40% of the estimated smoking households returned the coupons and ;25% entered the study, compared with an estimated 2% recruitment for population-based programs.\nIn this article, we report on both a partial replication and an extension of the first study. The replication lies in the inclusion of the same telephone counseling procedure as in our prior study. While telephone counseling for smoking cessation has become a major intervention modality with most states currently sponsoring helplines, such services have not been linked with utility company-sponsored programs. In prior research in healthcare settings, we have employed targeted videos as part of brief interventions. We reasoned that a video would be a compelling way to depict the hazards of radon and the radon-smoking synergy. Therefore, we created a 15-min video on radon and smoking which served as a second intervention. We hypothesized that both telephone counseling and the targeted video would have significant effects on cessation and the establishment of new household smoking bans.\nThe study extended our prior work in three additional ways. Whereas, our prior study was implemented in only one utility, here we recruited from several utility companies from diverse areas of the state. Second, we included households with radon levels above the action level of >4 pCi/l. Third, we conducted cost analyses for the two interventions. These low-intensity interventions can be delivered conveniently through electric utility companies and it would be useful to estimate their costeffectiveness.\n",

      "value": "The intervention was intended to be both effective and disseminable. We hypothesized that the radon issue would arouse motivation to engage in risk reduction actions and both the phone counseling and video would direct those actions primarily toward smoking reduction and secondarily toward structural mitigation.\nTelephone counseling consisted of one or two brief phone calls and the protocol was very similar to that employed in our prior study. Counselor training included role playing and regular meetings with a supervisor. Of the three counselors, one had conducted the bulk of the counseling in the prior study. The first call was delivered shortly after the household received their radon test result. The counselor clarified the combined risk of radon exposure and smoking and encouraged quitting smoking or not smoking in the home if quitting seemed not acceptable. The call was brief, supportive and nonconfrontational. Depending on interest, a second call was scheduled. Of the households assigned to phone counseling, 569 (84%) received one or more calls.\nHouseholds in the video condition received a 15-min video developed for this project, using animation, an exemplar family that included two children and a narrator. Animation illustrated the flow of radon from the ground mixing with cigarette smoke into household members' lungs. The family interaction depicted a smoking father who, initially, dismisses the radon report because the observed radon level was low, but is then persuaded that the combination of smoking and radon requires him to take action. To encourage viewing of the video, we enclosed a stamped, self-addressed postcard asking for their opinions about its quality. Returning the postcard would enter them in a drawing by which they could win a $100.00 prize.\nAll households received the EPA pamphlet, ÔA Citizens Guide to RadonÕ, and a cover letter explaining their results and implications for action. The cover letters varied depending on the radon levels observed. Households with radon levels <4 pCi/l were reminded that there was still significant Using radon risk to motivate smoking reduction risk because of the combination of radon and smoking that could be addressed by reducing smoking.

      "value": "Consistent with the analyses adopted in an earlier paper, outcomes are reported as the main effects in our 2 3 2 design, and we report on simple differences in proportions of quits or new bans. (In the cost analyses the cells were compared since it was of interest to distinguish video and telephone counseling costs.) This approach, called Ôtime naiveÕ maybe appropriate for measures such as Ôconsecutively reported bansÕ, but is not when data are missing and observations (e.g. smoking status) are nested within households. Both of these conditions obtain for data reported upon here and led us to employ nested longitudinal analyses and propensity measures to account for these influences. We confirmed the simple analyses using analogous longitudinal models and report the findings from the latter as odds ratios where these inform the simple analyses.\nTo accommodate attrition of households, logistic regression analyses were first used to construct a propensity measure of attrition at 3 or 12 months. Baseline predictors included treatment factor levels, baseline radon level, length of residence, whether home was owned or rented, whether home had a ban on indoor smoking at baseline, the gender of the respondent and whether the home had children under the age of 18. Two predictors were related to loss at 3 or 12 monthsphone treatment (27% missing) versus no phone treatment (21%), (v 2 = 8.26, df = 1, P < 0.004, OR = 1.44, CI = 1.12, 1.85) and whether the home Using radon risk to motivate smoking reduction was rented (33%) or owned (21%), (v 2 = 17.37, df = 1, P < 0.004, OR = 1.83, CI = 1.37, 2.44). The predicted values from the analysis were used as propensity scores which were entered as the first covariate in all subsequent regression analyses. The second analysis consideration was dictated by the fact that although household was the unit of randomization and analysis for some of the reported outcomes (e.g. smoking bans), other outcomes associated with individual behaviors (e.g. smoking status) required accounting for the effect of multiple individuals nested within some but not all households. About one-third of households contained more than one smoker. An examination of intrahousehold dependence for smoking status at each follow-up for these multiple smoker homes found intraclass correlations for 3-month, 12-month and both 3-and 12-month reported abstinence of 0.25, 0.42 and 0.28, respectively. To accommodate multiple smokers within some, but not all, households we created repeated measures analyses and corrected the covariance matrix for sampling design by clustering on household. These complex analyses yielded results generally consistent with simple analyses-e.g. chi square.\nFor the smoking cessation analyses, we restricted the data to those persons identified as smoking at baseline and, for bans analyses, to those households with no ban at baseline. For the outcome of household smoking bans, households were both the unit of assignment and the unit of analysis. Analysis of this outcome was similar to that for cessation, but did not incorporate a correction for nesting. The regression analyses entered the propensity score, the two intervention factors, the time contrast and time intervention interactions. As was the case with the first paper, both primary outcomes, cessation and bans, use Ôintent-to-treatÕ imputation, where participants or households lost to follow-up are considered smokers (or to not have a ban). Finally, the chi-square tests of the two interventions use a corrected alpha of 0.017(0.05/3), to account for directional hypotheses and correction for multiple testing.\n",

Although this was a much lower percentage of smoking homes than we reached in our prior study with one utilitywhere we were able to repeat the bill stuffer three times-it is still an efficient way to recruit smoking households. Once again, participants were cooperative with 76% of households completing both 3-and 12-month assessments.\nNeither telephone counseling nor the targeted video had a significant effect on longer term smoking cessation. Our prior study reported a nonsignificant trend between telephone counseling and quit rates, but a different analysis team incorrectly calculated the intraclass values and did not adjust for the intraclass correlations. The corrected values in our prior study are 0.39, 0.50 and 0.55 for 3-month, 12-month and both 3-and 12-month reported abstinence-similar to the values in this report. Application of analytic procedures correcting for the Intraclass Correlations to these earlier data show no significant effect of phone counseling on quitting. Telephone counseling was intentionally brief-the meantime of the first call was only 5.8 min-considerably less than provided by quitlines serving smokers seeking help to quit. Although phone counseling was related to 3-month cessation in this study, together our two studies show that very brief telephone counseling does not enhance longer term or sustained cessation in smoking households recruited because of their concerns about radon levels.\nBoth interventions, however, tended to increase the establishment of new household bans, although Using radon risk to motivate smoking reduction they did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. These results are consistent with the findings in our prior study. Those households which received both phone counseling and the video were especially likely to have anew ban at 12 months. Over both conditions, ;19% of households reported anew ban at the 12-month assessment.\nCommon to all conditions was experiential engagement with radon testing and received feedback and this may have increased bans. It is also likely that households selecting themselves into the study were predisposed to take risk reduction actions. Quitting smoking and establishing new bans were strongly associated as they were in our prior study. New bans were associated with the presence of younger and, especially, older children in the household. In our prior study using the same analytic procedures, we found no relationship between children in the home and new bans. The demographic and smoking histories of the participants in the two studies were very similar as were the baseline levels of smoking bans. This discrepancy between the two studies suggests the need for replication. However, the substantial relationship between children in the home and new bans in this study supports the meaningfulness of bans as an outcome since they appear to protect children from ETS. Given increased concerns about home ETS exposure for children, a radon-smoking intervention aimed at smoking households with children could be quite productive.\nIt was disappointing that so few of our households had radon levels above the action level set by EPA. The major utility we worked with was expected to have ;20% of its residences at high radon levels (based on radon mapping data from our geologist consultant), but relatively few of these found their way into our study. In spite of the low numbers, high radon levels were strongly associated with radon mitigation actions as well as with some changes in smoking behavior. It would be of great interest to test the intervention approach used herein residential areas where high radon levels are more prevalent.\nThe economic evaluation showed that the interventions were delivered at modest cost and were a cost-effective means of increasing household bans compared with the EPA brochure only. While we were able to assess the incremental costeffectiveness of the interventions in terms of smoking bans, we were notable to assess the impacts the additional bans had on future medical care costs, productivity and life-years saved. The costeffectiveness of efforts to reduce smoking has been well established, particularly compared with other health interventions Smoking cessation is considered the Ôgold standardÕ for preventive services. There are no published studies that have estimated these affects for household smoking bans. To the extent that the bans are maintained over the long term, benefits will likely accrue to nonsmokers who would have continued to be exposed in the home.\nSome limitations of this study must be noted. We relied on self-reports for both quitting smoking and for assessing smoking bans. While quit rates maybe slightly inflated, differential false reporting is likely to be minimal and not differential given the limited intervention contact. Few studies have examined the validity of self-reported smoking bans. Correlations between reports of number of cigarettes smoked in the home and ambient nicotine levels collected via a passive monitor have generally ranged from 0.73 to 0.86, suggesting relatively accurate reporting. A recent study reported a correlation of .49 in a sample of southern California households containing asthmatic children. The review of, reported ETS exposure does recommend biological markers but many of the studies covered in their review used more intensive interventions compared with ours. While some households may report new smoking bans because of social acceptability, the two low-intensity interventions seem unlikely to have influenced reports of bans especially at the 12-month follow-up.\nPublic Utility companies are an attractive, convenient medium for reaching smoking households and the radon-smoking synergy appears to attract the attention of smokers who maybe jaded about the usual risks of smoking. Focusing on smoking households with children maybe a particularly E. powerful way of exploiting the combined risks of radon and smoking. Such a targeted approach could be implemented in a managed care organization with a quality electronic medical records system.\n",
