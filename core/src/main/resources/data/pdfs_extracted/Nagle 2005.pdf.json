      "value": "Objective: Does the provision of a nursebased intervention lead to smoking cessation in hospital patients? Methods: At tertiary teaching hospital in Newcastle, Australia, 4,779 eligible (aged 18-80, admitted for at least 24 hours, and able to provide informed consent) and consenting (73.4%) in-patients were recruited into a larger cross-sectional survey. 1,422 (29.7%) smokers (in the last 12 months) were randomly assigned to control (n=711) or intervention group (n=711). The brief nurse-delivered intervention incorporated: tailored information, assessment of withdrawal, offer of nicotine replacement therapy, booklets, and a discharge letter. Selfreported cessation at 12 months was validated with CO and salivary cotinine. Results: There were no significant differences between groups in self-reported abstinence at three or 12 months post intervention, based on an intention to treat analysis. At three months, self-reported abstinence was 27.3% (I) and 27.5% (C); at 12 months was 18.5% (I) and 20.6% (C). There were no differences in validation of self-report between intervention and control groups at 12 months. Conclusion: This brief nurse-provided in-patient intervention did not significantly increase the smoking cessation rates compared with the control group at either three or 12-month follow-up. Implications: A systematic total quality improvement model of accountable outcome-focused treatment, incorporating assertive physician-led pharmacotherapy, routine assessment and recording of nicotine dependence (ICD 10 coding), inand outpatient services and engagement from multidisciplinary teams of health professionals maybe required to improve treatment modalities for this chronic addictive disorder.\n",

A second potential methodological limitation is the use of ward nurses in the intervention, which raises the potential for contamination of the control group. The general ward nurse elements of the intervention (in-service training of more than half of all nurses, the presence of Smoking Cessation Clinical Pathway tools on intervention patients' bed charts, the presence of training manuals at the nursing stations and the presence of the CNS in the wards every day) may have acted as prompts forward nurses to intervene with other patients in the ward (some in the control group). However, given the lack of documentation from any ward nurses indicating the delivery of any smoking cessation care to the \"identified and consenting\" patients in the intervention group, it would seem unlikely that ward nurses were delivering any smoking cessation care. It is probable that in the hectic and overloaded work environment of the ward, and the presence of the smoking cessation CNS on the ward (capable, trained and employed to deliver the care), that a low priority was given to smoking cessation care by ward nurses. The lack of adoption by usual ward nursing staff of the protocols for providing cessation care has also been noted by other researchers, with Hajek et al. suggesting that inconsistent delivery of the intervention raised concerns about the feasibility of incorporating smoking cessation interventions in routine care. It is possible that there may have been some contamination between intervention and control patient (transfer of booklets or exposure to the CNS bedside counselling session). However, the 711 intervention patients were dispersed throughout the hospital's 11,133 admissions in the year of the study.\nAnother possible explanation of the null effect in this study could be a Hawthorne effect. The control group received considerably more than the usual care received by smokers in a hospital setting. The control group were assessed at the bedside for smoking status and history, informed of a list of potential care they might receive if they agreed to participate in the study (including counselling, assessment of withdrawal symptoms, provision of booklets, offer of NRT and post discharge letter to their GP). Additionally, they were monitored over 12 months post discharge with follow-up telephone calls at three and 12 months by an interviewer asking about their smoking status, history since discharge and use of NRT. It is possible that these research components acted as an assessment and monitoring intervention and that the addition of the brief nurse intervention did not increase the cessation rates above this level. However, there is no evidence of the impact of such monitoring and assessment on cessation rates among hospital patients nor on the natural quit rate post hospitalisation. Both intervention and control conditions delivered a conservatively estimated point prevalence of abstinence at 12 months of 10% (based on classifying self-reported non smokers who were lost to follow-up, who refused biochemical validation, or who had CO >10ppm, as smokers).\nClinical practice guidelines for treating tobacco use and dependence recommend first-line pharmacotherapies (such as NRT) should be prescribed in the absence of contraindications. In our trial, the offer of NRT was accepted by only a small proportion of patients in the intervention group and an even lower proportion were eventually prescribed and received NRT (3%). This is similar to studies of NRT use during hospitalisation reported by and. It may require more assertive prescription of pharmacotherapy for this chronic addictive disorder from a physician (similar to pharmacotherapies for hyperlipidemia and hypertension) than the 'offer' of NRT by a nurse to achieve compliance with best practice guidelines.\nOf interest is the finding that of those patients who reported having quit smoking in the year prior to admission, only 65% (at three months) and 42% (at 12 months) reported being abstinent. This suggests that the risk of relapse is high among this population and that interventions to prevent relapse among recent quitter inpatients are appropriate.\n",

      "value": "During every weekday morning of the data collection period, patient data from the hospital admissions database were downloaded onto a temporary database (LAPSMOKE), including name, medical record number (MRN) and ward location. The research nurse with the LAPSMOKE database visited each ward and met with the nursing unit manager (NUM) or nominee, who was responsible for determining the eligibility of each patient in their ward to be approached for recruitment into the study by the research staff. The criteria for NUM exclusion were: physical inability to provide informed consent (e.g. deaf, brain injury, unconscious); mentally unable to provide informed consent (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease, anxiety, depression, under medication influence likely to impair informed consent); inability to speak English; unexpected early discharge; and unspecified reason (for confidentiality the NUM declined to provide a specific reason). Patients were classified as either eligible, permanently ineligible or potentially eligible (e.g. still recovering from anaesthetic and maybe eligible on a later day) to participate in the cross-sectional survey.\nAll eligible patients were approached at their bedside by the research assistant and provided with a standard information letter explaining the study and a consent form. The study was described to patients as being important for all patients, smokers and nonsmokers alike, particularly the bedside interview (admission interview schedule) about personal characteristics and smoking history (not part of this hospital's standard admission procedure), and access to medical records to provide diagnoses. The study was also described as involving possible receipt of information booklets, counselling about withdrawal symptoms, the offer of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), letter to their GP post discharge and follow-up telephone calls post discharge. In addition, they maybe asked for permission fora research assistant to visit their home to take a breath sample using a smokelyser or provide a salivary cotinine sample.\nA trained research assistant administered the admission interview schedule to all consenting patients, which comprised demographic and smoking status questions. Never smokers and ex-smokers (who had quit more than 12 months before admission) ended their participation here. Patients who reported smoking within the last 12 months (this included current smokers and those who had quit smoking in the preceding 12 months, who could all potentially benefit from the intervention) were entered by the research assistant at the patient's bedside into the LAPSMOKE program on a laptop computer, which gave an immediate random allocation to either control or intervention group that could not be changed. Randomisation was based on blocks of 20 patients being assigned to either control or intervention. Stratification into recent smoker and recent quitter categories occurred prior to randomisation. Patients assigned to the intervention group had a Smoking Cessation Clinical Pathway document placed on their bedside chart (identifying them toward nurses), and were also included in the client list for the clinical nurse specialist (CNS). Patients in the control group were not identified to either ward nurses or the CNS and were not approached further as part of the study during their hospital stay.\nAfter discharge, all patients in the RCT were contacted by telephone and surveyed at three and 12 months post discharge. Multiple attempts were made to telephone contact non-responders and after 10 unsuccessful attempts, patients were posted a survey and reply-paid envelope. Patients who were not contactable (but were not deceased or withdrawn) at three months were included at later follow-up. Research assistants were trained to deliver the telephone surveys and were blind to the allocation group. Investigators were blind to the results throughout the study and follow-up period.\nValidation by carbon monoxide and salivary cotinine measurement was carried out for all patients who reported abstinence at three and 12 months. A research assistant went to the home of the participants to obtain a saliva sample and perform carbon monoxide testing.\n",

Subsequent trials have found similar null results from a brief bedside intervention, which included a one-month follow-up telephone call (Rigotti 2000). Additionally, a United Kingdom (UK) trial of 540 patients with myocardial infarction, given either usual care (control) or a brief 20-minute bedside intervention, reported no difference in cessation rates between groups at either six weeks or 12 months. 10 Prior to discussing the implications and potential explanations for these findings, it is appropriate to review some aspects of the methodology used in this study.\nFirst, the strengths of the study included: outcome data based on an \"intention to treat\" analysis, the randomisation process provided no opportunity for interference, and the blinding process for outcome measurement removed potential bias among interviewers and investigators. The study used a large sample size recruited from medical record numbers on the HOSPAS database for all admissions. Biochemical validation was used for selfreported smoking status.

      "value": "The current study found that a brief nurse-provided in-hospital intervention did not increase the quit rate at three or 12 months post discharge, compared with the control group. One important outcome of this study is the finding that 10% (validated) of the control group had quit smoking at 12 months. Unfortunately, we do not have data on the spontaneous quit rate from hospitalisation. However, it is possible that the standardised assessment and monitoring of smoking status could yield abstinence rates of 10% (validated) at 12 months post discharge. Given the evidence for the efficacy of more intensive programs and the lack of evidence in this trial for brief interventions, a more co-ordinated systematic model seems necessary. For instance, the combination of multiple providers, in-patient and out-patient components, routine assessment and recording systems for coding of nicotine dependence (using the ICD-10 code of F17) on medical records together with more active pharmacotherapy could be beneficial.\nIt is notable that evidence of such an approach could be gathered using strategies other than large RCTs. For instance, a systematic, health system wide, total quality improvement model, which incorporates 12-month post discharge monitoring and feedback to hospital management on outcomes, has the potential overtime to increase outcomes. Compared with efforts put into the detection and treatment of hypertension, the relative lack of assessment and treatment of smoking in hospitals is unsatisfactory. In view of the burden on the hospital budget of smoking-related admissions, it is imperative that hospital and healthcare management adopt systematic, outcome-focused treatment modalities for this chronic addictive disorder.\n",
