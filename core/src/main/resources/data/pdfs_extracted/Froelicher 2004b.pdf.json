      "value": "Background-Although men hospitalized with cardiovascular disease (CVD) show high smoking-cessation rates, similar data for women are lacking. We tested the efficacy of smoking-cessation intervention in women hospitalized for CVD. Methods and Results-In this randomized controlled trial conducted from 1996 to 2001, 277 women diagnosed with CVD (mean age 6110 years) were randomly assigned within 1 of 12 San Francisco Bay Area hospitals to a usual-care group (UG; n135) or intervention group (IG; n񮽙142). Baseline histories were obtained, and interviews to ascertain self-reported smoking status occurred at 6, 12, 24, and 30 months after hospitalization. The UG received strong physician's advice, a self-help pamphlet, and a list of community resources. The IG received strong physician's advice and a nurse-managed cognitive behavioral relapse-prevention intervention at bedside, with telephone contact at intervals after discharge. The groups were similar demographically and had smoked cigarettes fora median of 38 (IG) or 40 (UG) years. Time to resumption of continuous smoking was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and risk differences between groups were determined. Time smoke-free was significantly greater for the IG than the UG (P񮽙0.038). Point prevalence for nonsmoking at the interviews was somewhat greater for the IG than the UG (P񮽙0.15 at all times). Conclusions-Cognitive behavioral intervention resulted in longer average times to resumption of smoking, but in these 2 groups of older women with limited social and financial resources, long-term success rates were similar. Systematic identification of smokers and even the brief intervention afforded the UG yielded a high smoking-cessation rate overtime. (Circulation. 2004;109:587-593.)",

Baseline assessment of demographic data from each participant's medical record included age, ethnicity (verified by the participant), education, marital status, employment status, and income. Clinical data included the medical history and index admission diagnosis and comorbid conditions. The Charlson Comorbidity Index 15 was used to assess concurrent comorbidities.\nThe smoking history evaluation consisted of a 43-item instrument developed for WINS that assesses levels of addiction, ease of quitting smoking, years of smoking, average number of cigarettes smoked daily, intent to refrain from smoking cigarettes, and confidence in being able to remain off cigarettes and includes questions about the effects of alcohol consumption and living arrangements.\nThe Stanford Dependency Index 16 was used to measure degree of addiction to nicotine. This instrument, derived from the Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire, 17 classifies addiction on the basis of 5 questions. Scores range from 0 to 25; test-retest correlations for the 5 questions ranged from 0.71 to 0.90. Smokers' beliefs and knowledge about health benefits of smoking cessation were ascertained from 3 standardized questionnaire items developed and tested in more than 4000 smokers in 20 communities in the United States in 1989 by the National Cancer Institute's Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation. Each item had 4 response choices: (1) How likely do you think it is that you will avoid or decrease serious health problems from smoking if you quit (\"very likely\" to \"very unlikely\")? (2) If a person has smoked for more than 20 years, there is little health benefit to quitting (\"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree\"). (3) My smoking is harming my health (\"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree\").\nA Confidence Questionnaire 14 lists 14 high-risk situations likely to cause a relapse to smoking. Participants were asked to rank their confidence that they could resist the urge to smoke in each situation on a scale of 0% (not at all confident) to 100% (very confident). A score of less than 70% denoted a high risk of relapse. The Burnam screening instrument, an 8-item screening tool for detecting depression, was also used.\nTesting for cotinine, a breakdown product of nicotine, was performed at 6 and 12 months after participants' enrollment in the trial. All women in both groups who reported that they had not smoked in the past 7 days, \"not even a puff,\" were asked fora saliva sample that was analyzed for cotinine to verify their nonsmoking status. Follow-up data were obtained in telephone calls made with a scripted interview, which were placed to all participants in both 588\nCirculation groups at 6, 12, 24, and 30 months after enrollment in the trial.

For each category, different questions were asked; for example, relapsers and continuous smokers were asked to identify the time and place of relapse, what triggered the relapse, and the number of cigarettes smoked. Participants were asked about withdrawal symptoms, exercise habits, use of pharmacological therapy to help them stop smoking, intention to remain or become a nonsmoker (scale of 1 to 7), and self-efficacy or confidence that they could do so (scale of 1 to 10). The women were also asked to identify healthcare resources they had used since their latest contact with the study, including physician's office visits, emergency-room visits, hospitalizations, and allied health services such as physical therapy and nutrition or psychological counseling. 22\n",

Depending on a woman's preference, her smoking history, and the Stanford Dependency Index, NRT was offered to selected women for 8 weeks in the form of a nicotine patch (Nicoderm, 14 mg or rarely 21 mg) or, in a few cases, nicotine gum (Nicorette, 2 or 4 mg). An information sheet about NRT use was developed and distributed with the medication, together with verbal and written instructions on the proper use of NRT. Before NRT was prescribed, we obtained approval from each woman's physician. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines of 1996 had cautioned against use of NRT by patients within 6 weeks of an acute coronary event, 24 but thereafter the safety of NRT was confirmed, even for such cardiac patients, on the basis of a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio associated with NRT usage as opposed to the patient's continued smoking. NRT became available on an over-the-counter basis after the present study began, but some participants in both groups obtained NRT and, very late in the study, bupropion (an antidepressant and a non-nicotine aid to smoking cessation) from their personal physicians.\n",

      "value": "This randomized controlled trial of women smokers hospitalized with CVD was designed to test the efficacy of a smoking cessation intervention in terms of no relapse to smoking or short-term (6 and 12 months) and long-term months) time to continuous smoking. The trial yielded 4 particularly important findings. First, the women assigned to the IG were significantly more likely to remain nonsmokers continuously than were those in the UG (P񮽙0.038). Second, both groups had high nonsmoking point prevalence at 6, 12, 24, and 30 months. Third, although the protocol included NRT for all eligible IG participants who resumed smoking, few reported using it. Conversely, a number of participants in the UG obtained NRT from their personal physician or when it became available over the counter. Fourth, survival analysis indicated that continuous nonsmoking rates after 12 months remained relatively unchanged at 24 and 30 months, supporting the view that 12 months is an adequate follow-up period.\nThe high confirmed smoking-cessation rate in the UG was unexpected, because usual-care groups inmost smoking trials 2,3,6 have consistently shown sustained cessation rates lower than those noted in the WINS (rates ranging from 21% to 40%). Several explanations are plausible. First, because of societal trends since the 1980s, the effect size of smokingcessation interventions has decreased from 26% 2 to 7%. The  *Myocardial infarction location: anterior 5.1%, inferior 11.2%, lateral 0.4%, combination 7.6%; MI criteria met: chest pain 22.7%, ECG changes 17.6%, increase in enzymes 23.4%. †Examples include arrhythmias, AAA, aortic stenosis, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease (not inclusive).\n‡AAA repair, aortofemoral bypass, pacemaker insertion, prosthetic valve insertion (not inclusive).\n§Burnam depression screening tool administered in hospital at baseline. report of an effect size of 26% 2 was from a study done with men who were hospitalized in a health maintenance organization for treatment of an infarction at a time when hospitals had few if any no-smoking policies and when the prevalence of smoking was higher than it is today. More recent studies in population samples that include men and women and have occurred since the introduction of no-smoking policies in hospitals beyond health maintenance organizations reflect social stipulations as well as interventions by government and businesses and demonstrate markedly reduced effect sizes. Such social factors may have influenced the smaller effect size found in the WINS. Second, the systematic identification of smokers, the brief intervention with a physician's advice, and the written materials provided to women in the UG, together with the consent procedures and the process of data collection for the trial, may have had an impact beyond that which would have resulted with routine hospital care, particularly considering that these study groups consisted in large part of older women with limited social and financial resources. Third, that the use of NRT was actually slightly higher in the UG (23%) than in the IG (20%) suggests that the patients in the UG may inadvertently have been encouraged to stop smoking more aggressively during their participation in the WINS trial than in the past.\n",

Although the WINS intervention protocol, designed in 1995, was a state-of-the-art behavioral intervention validated by US Public Health Service guidelines, advances since the study began argue for the possibility of higher levels of continued smoking cessation in women. These advances include the use of pharmacological therapies like NRT, even in the acute phase after myocardial infarction, and the use of bupropion. Such pharmacological interventions appear important in supporting women in smoking-cessation efforts. Consideration of future interventions must include all of the evidence-based strategies delineated in the 2000 tobacco dependence and use guidelines published by the US Public Health Service, which include appropriate identification of all smokers and a strong message issued by healthcare providers-including physicians, nurses, dentists, and others-about the hazards of smoking.

Moreover, it is likely that NRT use is a confounder by indication in WINS; that is, rather than offering NRT as an aid to smoking cessation from the beginning of the intervention, NRT was offered by WINS nurses only to women who relapsed to smoking. It is therefore likely that in the present study, use of NRT was a predictor of relapse rather than a predictor of smoking cessation. Second, the short hospital stay for some participants may have reduced the duration of the planned personal intervention. Third, although scheduled telephone contacts were based on prior assumptions about the physiology of withdrawal, both the number and the timing of contacts may not have been optimal for every woman participating.

There is some evidence from the WINS and other studies that a planned approach to smoking cessation that includes follow-up contact calls offering relapse prevention may lengthen the time to relapse or improve cessation rates. The combination of such a program and pharmacological therapy maybe especially important in helping patients who relapse and those who have not succeeded in quitting smoking in the past. A plan for discharge from the hospital should include active involvement of the patient's family in maintaining a smokingfree environment and the patient's referral to cardiac rehabilitation programs and community resources, such as the programs offered by the American Lung Association, the American Cancer Society, and Nicotine Anonymous groups.
