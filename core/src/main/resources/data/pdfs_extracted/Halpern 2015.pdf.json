Eligible participants were at least 18 years of age, reported smoking at least 5 cigarettes per day, had Internet access, and indicated an interest in learning about ways to stop smoking. Recruitment occurred from February 2012 through October 2012. Using the Way to Health Web-based research portal created for this and other studies, participants opened an account, electronically signed the informedconsent document, and completed a baseline questionnaire. Participants were told that they would be paid for completing questionnaires and submitting samples to confirm smoking abstinence and that the study tested different ways of providing financial incentives to promote cessation. To dissuade nonsmokers from enrolling, we also informed potential participants that we would randomly screen for baseline smoking.\nAfter randomization, participants learned the details of their assigned intervention, were asked to accept or decline their intervention, and chose a target quit date between 1 and 90 days after enrollment. We then selected a random sample of 5% of these enrolled participants to undergo baseline cotinine screening and offered $100 for completing a cotinine assay.\nParticipants were randomly assigned on an individual basis to one of five groups. Randomization was stratified according to two dichotomous variables: whether participants had full healthcare benefits through CVS Caremark and whether their annual household income was at least $60,000 (the CVS Caremark workforce median) or less than $60,000. We developed an adaptive randomization algorithm that updated the assignment probabilities to the five groups after every third enrolled participant. Updated probabilities reflected the inverse of the proportion of participants assigned to that group who accepted the intervention, relative to total acceptance across groups. This approach balances recruitment of accepting participants across groups by increasing the odds of randomization to interventions that previous participants declined.\nAll the participants were offered usual care, consisting of information about local smokingcessation resources, cessation guides produced by the American Cancer Society, and, for the 41% of the participants receiving health benefits through CVS Caremark, free access to a behavioral-modification program and nicotine-replacement therapy. Participants assigned to the two individual-incentive groups were also eligible to receive $200 if they had biochemically confirmed abstinence at each of three times: 14 days, 30 days, and 6 months after their target quit dates. Participants would get an additional $200 bonus at 6 months, fora total of $800 ( in the Supplementary Appendix). In the individual-deposit group, this sum included a $150 deposit that would be refunded to participants who quit smoking.\nIn the collaborative-reward and competitivedeposit groups, cohorts of six smokers each were formed on a rolling basis, linking participants\n",

In the collaborative-reward group, payments to successful group members at each time point increased with increasing group success rates, from $100 per time point if one participant quit to $600 per time point per participant if all six quit. We sought to foster collaboration among participants with the use of a Web-based chatroom through which they could communicate throughout the study.\nIn the competitive-deposit group, $150 deposits from each of six group members, plus a $450 matching reward per member ($3,600 total), was redistributed among members who quit at each time point. For example, if only two participants in a group quit at 14 days but returned to smoking by 30 days, those two participants would receive $600 each at 14 days, and there would be no further payouts to the members of that group. Members of competitive cohorts received accurate but anonymous descriptions of their competitors to make vivid the possibility that others might benefit from their own lack of change 21 without enabling participants to undermine a competitor's efforts.\nParticipants in the group-incentive groups were also given a $200 bonus if they sustained abstinence through 6 months. Thus, the four interventions differed in how incentives would accrue and be disbursed ( in the Supplementary Appendix), but the payment schedule and bonus were identical, and on the basis of anticipated success rates, we estimated that each intervention carried an expected value of $800.\n",

For users of nicotine-replacement therapy, a urinary sample with an anabasine concentration of less than 3 ng per milliliter was considered to show sustained abstinence. Participants who did not submit samples were coded as actively smoking. Secondary outcomes included the initial quit rate at 14 days, sustained abstinence for 30 days, and sustained abstinence through 12 months (i.e., 6 months after the final incentive disbursement).\nIncentive acceptance rates reflected the proportion of participants assigned to that incentive who agreed to the contract.

The values for contemplation stage include 10 participants in the precontemplation stage: 2 participants in the usual-care group, 2 participants in the individual-reward group, 2 participants in the collaborative-reward group, 3 participants in the individual-deposit group, and 1 participant in the competitive-deposit group.

      "value": "More than 50 years after the release of the first Surgeon General's report on the harmful effects of smoking, national policies, behavioral programs, and pharmacologic approaches have helped reduce smoking rates in the United States. However, the need for new approaches is clear because smoking remains the leading cause of preventable illness and death. In this large randomized trial across the United States, we found that four different incentive programs with expected values of $800 were each effective in promoting sustained abstinence from smoking. Perhaps the most important finding is that incentive programs that required people to deposit $150 of their own money were less effective overall than rewardbased programs of similar value because few people accepted such deposit programs. This was true despite the $650 reward offered to depositarm participants in addition to the return of their original $150 deposits. However, analyses that account for the different acceptance rates of the interventions showed that deposit-based incentives were substantially more efficacious than reward-based incentives among people who would have accepted either. The robustness of this result to reasonably large potential selection effects suggests that incentives that build on participants' loss aversion 13 may meaningfully change behavior.\nSecond, we found that group-oriented reward programs were not significantly more effective than individual-oriented programs. The results of this large trial are therefore consistent with those of small randomized, controlled trials of incentives for weight loss in which group-oriented Acceptance rates were adjusted for two stratifying variables : whether participants received their health insurance through CVS Caremark and whether their annual household income was at least $60,000 or less than $60,000. I bars denote 95% confidence intervals. In parentheses, the numerator indicates the number of participants accepting each intervention, and the denominator indicates the number of participants assigned to each intervention. The usual-care group is not shown, because there was no option to decline usual care.  payments, as compared with individual-oriented payments, produced small early benefits that were not sustained overtime. Finally, the finding that individual rewards of $800, as compared with usual care, nearly tripled the rate of smoking cessation among CVS Caremark employees and their friends and family confirms and extends the generalizability of our finding from a previous trial involving General Electric employees. 8 In addition to the public health effects of such smoking reductions, these findings are important for employers. Because employing a smoker is estimated to cost $5,816 more each year than employing a nonsmoker, even an $800 payment borne entirely by employers and paid only to those who quit would be highly cost-saving.\nThis study has limitations. First, the low rate of acceptance of the deposit programs required protocol modifications to restrict the proportions of participants who would be randomly assigned to those groups. Implementing these limitations preserved balance in participant characteristics across groups and preserved power for all effectiveness analyses but limited the precision of analyses comparing the efficacy of reward and deposit groups. Second, only 41% of the participants had access to free pharmacologic and behavioral cessation aids through their employee benefits. However, smoking-cessation rates were not higher among those with access to such aids, a finding that suggests that the superiority of incentives would hold in populations with universal access. Third, in all trial groups, nearly half the smokers who quit at the end of the intervention at 6 months did not document sustained abstinence through 12 months. This suggests similar durability of financial incentives to nicotine-replacement therapy and bupropion, for which relapse after completion of treatment has also occurred in roughly 50% of the participants. 41,42 Secondary analyses suggest that the true relapse rates in our trial may have been lower, given the reduction in submission of any samples at 12 months across groups.\nThis study also has several strengths. In addition to comparing financial incentives for smoking cessation in a large number of participants, the trial measured the specific contributions of acceptance and efficacy of the interventions to their overall effectiveness. This trial also compared multiple incentive programs with design features based on behavioral economic theory, including repeated payments to reinforce target behaviors, 43 bonus payments at the end of the intervention to offset smokers' tendencies to discount the importance of future events, 44,45 and the provision of ongoing feedback regarding participants' accrued gains and losses contingent on their self-reported smoking status to maximize the effect of regret aversion. 20,21 Finally, this trial randomly selected participants for screening cotinine tests to prevent nonsmokers from enrolling. The robustness of our findings in analyses accounting for potential participation of nonsmokers provides strong evidence regarding the effectiveness of incentives. The primary outcome was sustained abstinence through 6 months. Asterisks indicate P values (* for P<0.05, ** for P<0.01, and *** for P<0.001) for the comparison of the four intervention groups to usual care, with adjustment for the two stratifying variables : whether participants received their health insurance through CVS Caremark and whether their annual household income was at least $60,000 or less than $60,000. I bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. In summary, this trial shows that among several financial-incentive programs for smoking cessation, rewards for smoking cessation are more effective overall than are deposit-based contracts owing to their much higher rate of acceptance. In addition, the efficacy of depositbased contracts among those who use them and the cost-effectiveness of such contracts for employers suggest that future innovations in employee benefit design should seek to establish the effectiveness of smoking-cessation programs requiring deposits smaller than the $150 used in this trial.\nSupported by a grant from the National Cancer Institute (R01 CA159932, to Dr. Halpern), a grant from the National Institute on Aging (RC2 AG036592, to Drs.

In brief, this method uses the randomization group as an instrumental variable, thereby providing estimates of the efficacy of interventions among people who accept them. Unlike traditional per-protocol analyses, this approach uses data on all randomly assigned participants and adjusts estimates of efficacy for the selection biases that may arise if participants' decisions to accept or decline their assigned interventions are related to their underlying odds of smoking cessation. This analysis assumes that participants who would accept deposits would have also accepted rewards if rewards had instead been offered. Estimates are on the additive scale; thus, absolute risk differences are shown with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). â€  The efficacy of deposit contracts is statistically superior to the efficacy of rewards as long as the underlying odds of quitting among participants who accept deposits are no more than 12.5 times greater than the odds of quitting among participants who would only accept rewards.\n",
