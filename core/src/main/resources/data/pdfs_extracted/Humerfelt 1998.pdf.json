After smoking cessation, subjects at risk for OLD will reduce the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to that of never-smokers, and respiratory symptoms will improve. Quitting smoking in asbestos-exposed individuals is particularly important due to the interaction between asbestos and cigarette smoking in the development of lung cancer.\nMinimal smoking interventions include written or verbal advice with or without information letters, pamphlets, books or maintenance programmes given individually or in groups. There have been very few communitybased intervention trials using randomization, control groups and biochemical validation of outcome in subjects at risk for OLD.\nRespiratory physicians have great responsibilities in smoking cessation, both to their individual patients and the community. Ina community it was unknown whether postal smoking cessation advice from a respiratory physician could be successful in young adult males at high-risk for lung cancer and OLD. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of such an advice in male smokers who had attended a spirometry survey. The secondary aims were to evaluate whether information to the smoker on the presence of reduced FEV1 and the harmful effects from asbestos had any additional effects on smoking cessation. Furthermore, we wanted to identify other possible predictors of smoking cessation.\n",

ABSTRACT: There have been few community-based randomized, controlled intervention trials for cessation in high-risk smokers. In such atrial we evaluated the effects of postal smoking cessation advice in smokers with asbestos exposure and/or reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).\nAll men aged 30-45 yrs (n=22,392) living in 34 municipalities in western Norway were invited to a cross-sectional community survey. Information on smoking habits and occupational asbestos exposure were obtained from self-administered questionnaires and measurements of FEV1 were performed with dry-wedge bellow spirometers. Among 16,393 participants we identified a group of 2,610 smokers with previous occupational asbestos exposure and/or adjusted FEV1 in the lowest quartile. A random half (n=1,300) received a mailed personal letter from a respiratory physician with a person-specific health advice to quit smoking and a pamphlet on smoking cessation. The remaining smokers (n=1,310) acted as controls and did not receive any information.\nTwelve months after the intervention, information on smoking habits was re-examined using a postal questionnaire. Among the respondents (n=2,282), smoking cessation was reported altogether by 13.7% in the intervention group versus 9.9% in the control group (p<0.01). The 1 yr sustained quit rate (no smoking at all during the last year) was 5.6 versus 3.5% (p<0.05), respectively. Measurements of carbon monoxide in expired air (with ð10 parts per million) confirmed self-reported nonsmoking in samples of the two groups.\nIna community this simple postal smoking cessation advice from a respiratory physician based on person-specific risk factors improved the 1 yr sustained success rate by 60% in identified high-risk smokers. exposure was obtained from a self-administered questionnaire and measurements were performed of height, weight and spirometry in all attendants. Forced expirations were recorded using dry-wedge spirometers (Vitalograph S-model; Vitalograph Ltd., Buckingham, UK). The highest of three FEV1 values were used in the analyses after correcting for body temperature and pressure saturated (BTPS) conditions. Age-and height-adjusted FEV1 levels were calculated using regression coefficients forage and body-height based on the Norwegian reference population of healthy asymptomatic men from the city of Oslo. The regression coefficients used were -0.032 L·yr -1 and 5.742 L·min -1 , respectively, with a constant of -4.540 and residual standard deviation of 0.549 L. Age-and height-standardized residuals of maximum values of FEV1 (SFEV1) were used as determinants of lung function level.\nSample size end subjects included in the randomized controlled trial\nWhen designing this trial we calculated that 1,300 subjects (response rate of 70%) would be necessary in each group in order to detect (alpha=0.05; beta=0.20) a significant difference after 12 months of a 5% sustained change in the intervention group versus 2.5% change in the control group.\nBased on information from all participants who had attended the initial survey by October 1989, we identified atrial population of 3,384 men as high-risk smokers (table 1). They included current smokers with either previous occupational asbestos exposure (n=1,558), an age-and height-adjusted FEV1 within the lowest quartile (reduced FEV1: n=1,293) or both (n=533). In order to obtain the needed sample size, a random 77% of the 3,384 subjects were drawn, giving 2,610 subjects. These included 1,186, 1,014 and 410 subjects in the three subgroups, respectively. They were included in a randomized controlled trial where each individual had a 50% chance of being drawn to the intervention group (n=1,300) or control group (n= 1,310), respectively. On January 15, 1990, a letter was mailed from a respiratory physician to the subjects in the intervention group. This postal advice included personspecific health advice to quit smoking and a pamphlet on smoking cessation.\nEach letter had name and address of the recipient printed in the same quality as the rest of the letter. The subject was reminded of his specific answers on smoking and asbestos exposure given at attendance to the initial survey as well as the results from his FEV1 measurements. Information was given about the dangers of continued smoking, especially if exposed to asbestos, having a reduced FEV1 or both risk factors. The letter stated that the recipient belonged to a group of subjects at increased risk for smoking-related lung disease. The recipient was therefore strongly advised to quit. Beneficial effects of smoking cessation were stated, and the recipient was encouraged to read the enclosed pamphlet produced by the Norwegian Cancer Society. Each letter was individually and personally signed by the physician. The pamphlet: \"How to become an exsmoker\", sized 10 cm by 14 cm in 15 pages, emphasized behavioural modification techniques in smoking cessation and recommended an early quit date. The remaining 1,310 subjects acted as controls and did not receive any information. The trial was approved by the Regional Committee of Medical Research Ethics.\n",

Without mentioning the letter given to the intervention group 12 months previously, all subjects were asked to return the questionnaire. If this was not returned, reminder letters were sent 3 and 6 weeks later. The wording on the questions on smoking was identical to that used at the initial survey. Subjects who reported nonsmoking were also asked to give month and year of quitting.\nSuccessful smoking cessation was defined as individuals who at follow-up denied daily smoking. These subjects living in 11 neighbouring municipalities of Bergen included 60 subjects from the control group and 73 from the intervention group.

      "value": "The trial population included 21% of all participants from the cross-sectional survey and 47% of all attending smokers. Subjects identified in the three subgroups of the trial population had similar age and body-height as all participants at the initial survey. Similar daily cigarette consumption was observed within the three subgroups (mean ±SD: 16±7 cigarettes·day -1 ). This was on average two cigarettes more per day than among all participating smokers (mean±SD: 14±7 cigarettes·day -1 ; p<0.05). The prevalence of self-reported occupational asbestos exposure in this community of men aged 30-45 yrs was 25% (19% low, 5% medium end 1% high level of exposure) versus 62% in the trial population.\nSubjects in the intervention group and the control group were well balanced regarding the distribution of inclusion criteria, age, age at smoking onset, body-height, daily cigarette consumption, respiratory symptoms and FEV1 level.\nAt follow-up, four intervention and three control subjects were dead. Among the remaining subjects the overall response rate after two reminder letters was 87% (n= 2,282), being lower (p<0.001) in the intervention group (83%) than in the control group (92%) (table 3). In the former group, the response rate was inversely related to daily cigarette consumption from the initial survey, being 87, 84 and 81% in smokers of <10 (light), 10-19 (medium) and Š20 (heavy) cigarettes·day -1 , respectively. No such trend was present in the control group.\nAmong the respondents at follow-up, 13.7% (n=148) in the intervention group versus 9.9% (n=119) in the control group reported nonsmoking (p<0.01). These subjects included those who stopped smoking during \"run in\" and those who stopped thereafter (after January 1, 1990) during the intervention period (table 3). If we assume that none of the nonrespondents at follow-up stopped smoking, the overall cessation rates (with intention to treat) were 11.4% versus 9.1% (p=0.05), respectively. After excluding subjects who stopped smoking during \"run in\" (32 subjects in each group) the 12 month cessation rates among the remaining respondents in the two groups were 11.1% (116 out of 1049) versus 7.4% (87 out of 1169), respectively (p<0.01). Although the effect from the postal advice was higher in subjects with reduced FEV1 (OR=1.7; 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.2-2.5) than in those with asbestos exposure (OR=1.2; 95%CI: 0.8-1.7), this difference in effect was not statistically significant (Chi-squared test for homogeneity: p=0.12). illustrates self-reported month of smoking cessation in the two groups. After the postal advice was sent in January 1990 a gradual increase in the cessation rate was observed for the first three months) in the intervention group compared with that in the control group. Thereafter, the excess gained in the intervention group was maintained until the end of follow-up. The 1 yr sustained success rate by March 1991 (no smoking at all during the preceding 12 months) was 5.6% in the intervention group versus 3.5% (p<0.05) in the control group (. This corresponds to 60% improvement in success following the postal advice.\nThe cessation rates were inversely related to daily cigarette consumption at initial survey (table 3). Quitters in the intervention and control groups smoked less at the initial survey and were slightly older at smoking onset (p<0.01) than those who did not stop with mean±SD values being 13±7 versus 16±7 cigarettes·day -1 and 18±4 versus 17±3 yrs, respectively. Among smokers at follow-up the mean±SD daily cigarette consumption in the intervention group was reduced to 14±9 versus 15±9 cigarettes in the control group (p<0.05). In these subjects the linear regression coefficient for initial daily cigarette consumption as a predictor for consumption at follow-up was lower in the intervention group (0.69; SE: 0.03; p<0.001) than in the control group (0.77; SE: 0.03; p<0.001), although these coefficients were not statistically different. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted OR for smoking cessation at follow-up after adjustment for group, age, age at smoking onset, daily cigarette consumption and subgroup of smokers (table 4). The postal advice remained as an independent predictor of smoking cessation. Similar effects were observed in subjects informed on the presence of asbestos exposure, reduced FEV1 or both risk factors. However, older age at smoking onset and low daily cigarette consumption were observed as independent predictors of smoking cessation. No significant first-order interactions were found (no departure from a multiplicative model) from any combinations of the covariables on the risk of smoking cessation.\nSimilar attendance (86%) to the validation survey was observed in samples of the two groups denying nonsmoking at follow-up). The attendance rates were related to the length of smoking cessation prior to follow-up, being 100% in the intervention group and 90% in the control group in those who remained nonsmoking for Š6 months (long-term quitters) compared to 69 and 83%, respectively, in those who had stopped smoking during the last 6 months (short-term quitters) prior to follow-up. At attendance, altogether 24 subjects had relapsed whereas 90 subjects reported nonsmoking (table 5). Higher relapse rates were observed in short-term quitters (being 33% in the intervention group and 38% in the control group) than in long-term quitters (being 13 and 18%, respectively; p< 0.01).\nAmong those claiming nonsmoking in the intervention group (n=50) and in the control group (n=40), a concentration of CO ð10 ppm in expired air was obtained in 49 versus 38 subjects, respectively (table 5). Based on these CO measurements, in June 1991 the cumulative 18 months success rates from January 1990 (after excluding 14 and 17 subjects, respectively, who had quit smoking during \"run in\") were 6.5% (35 out of 537) in the intervention group versus 3.6% (21 out of 589) in the control group (p<0.05) (table 5).

      "value": "This randomized controlled trial showed that postal smoking cessation advice from a respiratory physician improved the 1 yr sustained quit rate by 60% in identified high-risk smokers. This effect appeared to be directly attributable to our intervention. The two groups were well matched at baseline, and assignment to intervention and control groups was completely random. Both groups had identical cessation rates (3%) during the \"run in\" period prior to the intervention with the difference in cessation rates appearing thereafter. Follow-up rates were >80% in both groups and the validation survey confirmed the observed higher cessation rate in the intervention group compared with that in the control group.\nSelection bias may have affected our results. The response rate at the initial survey was 73% and the participants had similar demographic characteristics, smoking habits and respiratory symptoms as all men aged 30-45 yrs from the general population in Norway. At follow-up, 87% response was obtained. Similar initial characteristics of age, age at smoking onset, daily cigarette consumption, respiratory symptoms, asbestos exposure and FEV1 level were observed in respondents and nonrespondents from both the intervention and control groups. In agreement with an intervention study in male British civil servants, we observed a higher response rate at follow-up in the control group than in the intervention group. One explanation for this difference could be that the follow-up questionnaire was deliberately made impersonal and standardized to avoid pressure on intervention subjects to deny or underestimate continued smoking. Consistent with this we observed that medium and heavy smokers from the initial survey made less effort to answer the follow-up questionnaire in the intervention group than in the control group. Thus, higher smoker rates could possibly be present in nonrespondents from the intervention group than in those from the control group. If present, this would reduce the difference between the two groups. If we speculate that the cessation rate in nonrespondents from the control group (n=109) was 9.9% (identical to the observed success rate in the respondents) and in those from the intervention group (n=219) two thirds of this (6.6%), the overall success rates would have been 9.9 versus 12.5% (p<0.05), respectively. From this it seems unlikely that response bias will change our main conclusions of a statistically significant effect from the intervention.\nPrevious intervention trials have shown that smoking cessation based on self-reports need to be interpreted conservatively due to a high implicit demand on subjects to report positive change. However, this bias in outcome assessment is unlikely to have had considerable influence on our results since we observed good agreement between self-reported smoking cessation and objective CO measurements in subjects from both groups. Similar observa-tions have previously been observed in asbestos-exposed Norwegian men aged 45-65 yrs who participated in a smok-ing cessation programme. Furthermore, our validation survey also showed that the proportion of subjects claiming smoking (21%) and nonsmoking with CO in expired air >10 ppm (3%) was similar in the two groups. It is therefore unlikely that men from the intervention group may have responded rather more optimistically to the follow-up questionnaire than subjects in the control group. However, our results should be interpreted with some caution as CO with its short half-life was only measured once in nonrepresentative samples of subjects. In the validation survey we also observed higher relapse rates in short-term quitters than in long-term quitters. This explained the accelerated increase in the self-reported cessation rate that was observed in short-term quitters from both groups (, where 35% subsequently relapsed into smoking.\nPrevious studies have shown that about one third of all smokers make a serious quit attempt each year. However, more than 95% of them relapse, whereas a maximum of 5% succeed, leaving approximately 1.7% (33 × 5%) as successful sustained quitters after 1 yr. This was observed in the late 1970s in the USA and was half of the 3.5% 1 yr quit rate observed in the control group of our trial in 1990-1991 (. One reason for this difference could be the recent more positive attitude to smoking cessation in Norway.\nThe observed effect from our postal advice is difficult to compare with other intervention studies due to differences in intervention programmes, trial populations, length of follow-up and outcome measures. We used a minimal intervention that could easily be implemented elsewhere when performing cross-sectional surveys in high-risk smokers. Postal advice was applied in this geographical area due to long distance between subjects and respiratory physician as well as the large number of subjects at risk in the community. Using our inclusion criteria the trial population included altogether 47% of all smokers in the community. Subjects included in other community-based intervention studies are usually self-recruited and highly motivated to quit smoking. In our trial, however, all attending smokers fulfilling the inclusion criteria had equal chance of being selected into the trial, thereby also including smokers without any motivation to quit. This reflects the overall modest 1 yr sustained abstinence rate of 5.6% following our postal advice. Thus, future community studies should also include information on degree of motivation to quit in order to compare success rates between different intervention trials.

This is in contrast to the Lung Health Study and the Collaborative European Anti-smoking Evaluation (CEASE) Trial where only smokers of Š10 and Š15 cigarettes·day -1 , respectively, were included. The observed 1 yr sustained quit rate in our trial is similar to results from previous minimal intervention studies. Ina previous community-based study using media announcements from the American Lung Association in self-recruited highly motivated smokers, 12 months sustained cessation was obtained in 5% after having received postal cessation and maintenance manuals, versus 2% in controls. Thus, community programmes achieve modest effects in terms of the percentage of smokers who actually quit, but quite substantial numbers when one considers all smokers reached and at low cost.\nIn smokers attending their local doctor, brief verbal smoking cessation advice together with a cessation leaflet and a warning about follow-up was more efficient than advice given alone or no advice. These methods gave 12 months sustained abstinence rates of 5, 3 and 1%, respectively. In patients with smoking-related lung disease, a 5% 1 yr success was obtained following verbal advice to quit from respiratory physicians. Six subsequent letters of encouragement improved the outcome to 9%. A nurse-conducted advice in a lung clinic gave a 1 yr cessation rate of 3% versus 1% in the control group.\nIn agreement with previous intervention studies without the use of nicotine replacement, we observed that the degree of cessation was inversely related to daily cigarette consumption. This is taken as an indicator of the addictive properties of smoking (both psychological and nicotine dependences), making it more difficult for heavy smokers to quit than light smokers. Neither the letter nor the pamphlet in our trial included any information on the use of nicotine replacement. Attempts to improve our postal advice by including additional information on nicotine dependence and replacement therapy could possibly have improved our success rates.\nSeveral studies among selected groups have found little impact from the presence of respiratory symptoms on smoking cessation. Ina study of 467 coal miners, the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms was inversely related to cessation. Similarly, we observed that respiratory symptoms were less prevalent among subjects who stopped smoking compared with those who did not, although only morning cough and phlegm reached the 5% level of statistical significance. These effects, however, disappeared after adjusting for cigarette consumption. This suggests that, in subjects with respiratory symptoms, the addictive properties of smoking are more important than the motivation and ability to stop. This is in contrast to subjects with other diseases where the disease onset is more rapid and dramatic (e.g. myocardial infarction).\nRespiratory physicians have a great task to care for smokers, especially when they are at high risk. In this community trial a simple and cheap postal smoking cessation advice from a respiratory physician was useful in men identified with increased risk for smoking-related lung disease. Based on our estimates, such a programme could improve the 1 yr sustained success rate by 28%, i.e. a 60% improvement in 47% of all smokers in the community.\n",
