Based on the rationale that preventing weight gain would improve cessation rates, initial treatment approaches for weight-concerned smokers involved adding weight control interventions (ie, dieting) to cessation counseling. However, weight control interventions have not improved rates of sustained abstinence and may even be counterproductive. We reasonedthataddressingtheconcernssmokers have about postcessation weight gain might be a more appropriate treatment target than prevention of the weight gain itself. Therefore, we developed 6 and evaluated 5 a cognitive behavioral intervention designed to address women's concerns about postcessation weight gain.\nIn our previous investigation, we compared standard smoking cessation counseling plus 3 distinct adjunctive treatments equated for therapeutic time and attention: cognitive behavioral therapy for weight concerns (CONCERNS), behavioral weight control (BW), or standard cessation treatment with added discussion of smoking topics but no specific weight focus (STANDARD). No medication was provided. Results documented that CONCERNS, but not BW, was associated with significantly improved abstinence at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments, relative to STANDARD. Continuous, biochemically verified abstinence rates at 1 year were 21%, 13%, and 9% in CONCERNS, BW, and STANDARD, respectively.\nBecause pharmacologic approaches to smoking cessation are used frequently in clinical practice and are more effective when combined with cessation counseling, we sought to test whether adding pharmacotherapy to the CONCERNS intervention would enhance smoking cessation in weight concerned women. We reasoned that bupropion hydrochloride sustained release, a widely used, efficacious smoking cessation agent, would be particularly effective in combination with CONCERNS for weight-concerned women because of its ability to attenuate weight gain and relieve negative mood. Specifically, bupropion therapy has been shown to decrease weight gain following cessation at the end of a 7-week treatment period 16,17 and 1 year later. In addition, weightconcerned women smokers are likely to have had previous episodes of depression and enter cessation treatment with elevated depressive symptoms. Bupropion therapy may alleviate depressive symptoms associated with cessation. Accordingly, this study was designed to test whether the combination of bupropion therapy and weight concerns counseling would improve rates of sustained abstinence among weight-concerned women smokers. We hypothesized that the addition of bupropion to CONCERNS would increase rates of smoking abstinence relative to placebo. We also hypothesized that, among those taking bupropion, weight concerns counseling would be more efficacious than standard smoking cessation treatment, and that for those receiving standard cessation counseling, bupropion therapy would produce higher abstinence rates compared with placebo. Finally, we sought to evaluate the combination of weight concerns counseling and bupropion therapy on postcessation weight gain as well as mood, nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and weight gain concerns.\n",

Sessions included education about cessation-related weight gain, the benefits of cessation relative to a modest weight gain, and the disadvantages of trying to diet while quitting.

Results of this trial suggest that the combination of bupropion therapy and a cognitive behavioral treatment designed to address women's concerns about postcessation weight gain improves smoking cessation outcome. Specifically, the combination produced the highest rate of prolonged abstinence and significantly delayed relapse during the 6 months of medication use. However, among women in the present study receiving bupropion, the CONCERNS intervention only marginally enhanced cessation rates at the 6-month assessment, and the differences between CONCERNS and STANDARD were not statistically significant at 1 year.\nAlthough the size of the effect of CONCERNS񮽙B on abstinence was small, the benefits of the combined intervention are noteworthy. Previous interventions that have combined a pharmacologic approach, specifically nicotine replacement, with behavioral weight control to help smokers quit smoking have failed to improve quit rates. In contrast, the current findings suggest that adding bupropion therapy (and perhaps other smoking cessation medications) to a specialized counseling intervention for weight-concerned smokers enhances quit rates, particularly during the period of active treatment (ie, 6 months in this study). Thus, the combination of pharmacologic and intensified counseling for weight concerns may produce the best cessation rates for women smokers concerned about postcessation weight gain, a subgroup with particular difficulty quitting.

See legend for abbreviations.\nMoreover,althoughCONCERNS񮽙Bdidnotaffectwom-en's level of weight gain concern, these findings demonstrating the benefits of the combination suggest that the mechanisms by which this combined treatment aids abstinence warrant further research. The CONCERNS񮽙B intervention may act completely separately from weight concerns, or current measures of change in weight concerns may not be sensitive to the impact of intervention. Research using larger samples to examine the interactions among mood, weight gain, and weight concerns may help explain successful cessation. Given the public health importance of smoking cessation, an intervention that can improve rates of prolonged abstinence among a refractory group of women smokers 2-4 warrants further consideration.\nTwo additional results merit comment. First, the finding that the combination of STANDARD񮽙B was not associated with significantly higher abstinence rates or better time to relapse relative to STANDARD񮽙P during drug treatment may suggest alack of efficacy for bupropion among weight-concerned women smokers. However, given the small sample size for this contrast, results should be interpreted cautiously. Second, the nonsignificant difference in abstinence rates at 1 year between the CONCERNS and STANDARD interventions among women taking bupropion is in contrast to findings from our prior trial, 5 in which CONCERNS intervention without medication improved rates of smoking abstinence and attenuated weight gained after cessation among a sample of women similar in demographic characteristics to the women in the present study. Thus, it maybe that weight-concerned women smokers interested in pharmacotherapy differ from those who present fora nonmedication trial in ways we did not assessor that the lack of weight gain attenuation for women receiving CONCERNS intervention relates to the differences in results between these trials.\nIn conclusion, among weight-concerned women smokers, bupropion therapy increased cessation rates when added to a specialized weight concerns intervention, but not when added to STANDARD counseling. When combined with bupropion therapy, the weight concerns counseling intervention tended to improve cessation rates and significantly lengthened abstinence duration during the period of active treatment, relative to STANDARD cessation counseling. Future research should focus on possible mechanisms to explain the efficacy of this specialized counseling plus bupropion therapy and address issues related to the practicality of wider dissemination of the specialized counseling intervention for weight-concerned women smokers. These results may also serve to guide further development of pharmacologic and behavioral approaches for smokers with other comorbid concerns.
