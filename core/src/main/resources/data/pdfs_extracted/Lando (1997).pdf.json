      "value": "Eligibility requirements included being between 18 and 65 years of age, having a history of smoking a minimum of 20 cigarettes daily for at least 2 years, and (female subjects only) using an acceptable method of birth control if sexually active. In addition, subjects were required to be motivated to quit smoking, as reflected in a rating of 7 or more on a 0 to 10 scale of desire to quit.2 Exclusion criteria included selfreported positive history of heart disease, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes; self-reported history of skin irritation or known allergy to adhesives that would preclude use of a transdermal system; current or recent treatment for psychiatric illness or chemical dependency (less than 6 months since completion of treatment); current excessive use of alcohol (consuming seven drinks more than three times per week); self-reported regular use of psychotropic medications, systemic steroids, or antihistamines; pregnancy, lactation, or intention to become pregnant during the study; and current use of any alternative forms of nicotine replacement therapy.\nStudy staff interviewed 912 patients for study eligibility. Of these 912 patients, 403 were eliminated. The major reasons for exclusion were as follows: 68 (17%) were taking antidepressants, 56 (14%) smoked fewer than 20 cigarettes per day, 52 (13%) failed to attend the orientation session, 40 (10%) were more than 65 years of age, 25 (6%) could not be reached to schedule the orientation, 22 (5%) reported a low motivation to quit (a score of less than 7 on the desire to quit scale), and 19 (5%) were not members of Group Health Inc.\nPrior to randomization, subjects had smoked an average of 27.8 cigarettes per day and had smoked for an average of 23.4 years. A substantial percentage of subjects had previous experience with nicotine replacement: 34.8% had used nicotine gum, and 12.0% had used a nicotine patch. Orientation Session All eligible participants were invited to a group orientation session. Subjects were randomly assigned to condition by orientation session attended. Orientation sessions were formed on the basis of sign-ups for specific dates and times. Subjects did not know their study condition in advance. A randomized block design was used in which each sequential set of three orientation sessions included the three study conditions. Study conditions were as follows: group orientation session alone, orientation session plus reactive telephone support (subjects were strongly encouraged to calla telephone hot line operated by the patch manufacturer), and orientation session plus both reactive telephone support and active telephone outreach. Orientation sessions were approximately 90 minutes in duration. The sessions were led by a Group Health Inc physician (D.K.) and the study coordinator (L.C.).\nAt the orientation session, subjects were given an overview of the study, an explanation of data collection forms, instructions for proper use of the patch, and information on the side effects related to smoking cessation and the patch. Information was provided pertaining to behavioral and psychological issues in quitting smoking, and subjects were encouraged to ask questions. Thirty-five orientation sessions were conducted. The overall study goal was to recruit 500 subjects. Once that goal was reached, no further orientation sessions were scheduled. Only 5% of those who signed up for orientation sessions failed to attend. Subjects set their own quit dates but were strongly encouraged to set dates within a maximum of 2 to 3 weeks of the orientation session. Study Design All subjects received prescriptions for PROSTEP 22-mg nicotine patches (Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Radnor, Pa), which were provided free to study participants. Subjects were required to fill the prescriptions at an assigned HMO pharmacy. Initial prescriptions were for 2 weeks. Subjects could renew the prescriptions for an additional 4 weeks and then had the option of requesting an additional 2-week prescription for an 11-mg patch.\nThe standard written materials describing patches and providing recommendations for appropriate use were provided when subjects filled their prescriptions.22\nSubjects were encouraged to use patches for the full 6 weeks unless they experienced significant side effects or engaged in smoking or other tobacco use. Group orientation subjects received this treatment and no additional support. The package insert with the nicotine patch contained information on Lederle Support Services, including a description of a toll-free telephone helpline. These services also were described in the informed consent signed by subjects.\nIn addition to prescriptions for the nicotine patch, subjects assigned to the help-line condition received a registration card for Lederle Support Services, which they could complete and turn in at the group orientation session. The toll-free support services number was discussed at the orientation session and subjects were strongly encouraged to call.\nIn addition to the previously described intervention components, counselors placed four telephone calls to subjects assigned to the help-line-plus-outreach condition. Both counselors had gained experience in placing supportive telephone calls to subjects in other smoking cessation studies.'7'23 For the current study, they received additional instruction and materials specifically pertaining to nicotine patches.2'22,24\nThe initial call was to occur within 1 week of the quit date; the second, within 4 weeks; the third, within 7 to 9 weeks; and the fourth, within 12 weeks. Telephoners ascertained that subjects had filled their prescriptions for PROSTEP. Reactions to and problems with the patch were discussed. Subjects were advised to consult the study physician in the event of systemic or skin reactions. Adverse events and concomitant medications were to be recorded on study forms. Telephone counselors attempted to reinforce success in those who were abstinent. In all calls, an attempt was made to negotiate anew quit date with subjects who were smoking. The telephone counselor aided the subjects in identifying personally relevant coping strategies for immediate abstinence and continued maintenance. Subjects who were experiencing continuing difficulties in remaining abstinent were alerted to other local smoking cessation resources.\n",

      "value": "Brief questionnaires were mailed to subjects, together with postage-paid return envelopes, 2, 5, 8, and 12 weeks after their quit dates. For purposes of followup, the quit date was the initial date established by the subject; this was true even for those subjects who negotiated anew quit date. Additional, more extensive questionnaires were mailed 6 and 12 months following subjects' quit dates. Subjects reported on their use of nicotine patches, quitting behaviors, and smoking status. In addition, the rate of filling prescriptions was monitored through computerized pharmacy records. Subjects who were assigned to the two groups with support services were asked about their use of the services.\nSubjects who reported abstinence at the 6-month follow-up  The key outcome in the current study was considered to be abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. Extensive efforts were made to contact subjects by mail and by telephone at this point. The overall response rate at 6 months was 99%. Response rates at earlier follow-ups were as follows: 81% at week 2, 71% at week 5, 60% at week 8, and 67% at week 12. The response rate at 12 months was 82%. There were no differences in response rates between conditions. Nonrespondents were counted as smokers for purposes of data analysis.\nLederle records indicated that fewer than 1% of eligible subjects called Lederle Support Services for counseling, despite strong encouragement to do so. Pharmacy dispensing records indicated that, on average, study subjects filled 5 weeks of 22-mg patch prescriptions and 1 week of 11 -mg patch prescriptions. No differences were found between groups in number of patches dispensed. There were no reports of discontinuation of patch use because of adverse events.\nAn average of 3.76 of a possible 4 calls were completed. Refusals to accept calls were rare and totaled only three for all subjects combined. Only 0.6% of subjects could not be reached by telephone at all, 2.5% of subjects were reached no more than once, 8.1% were reached for 2 or fewer calls, and 13% were reached for 3 calls or fewer. Calls averaged between 10 and 15 minutes in duration.\nAbstinence outcomes are presented in. At no point did outcome differences between the three conditions approach statistical significance. The carbon monoxide assessments administered at the 6-month follow-up tended to corroborate subjects' self-reports. Of the 111 subjects who reported 6-month abstinence, 105 (96%) evidenced carbon monoxide levels below the cutoff for disconfirmation (8 parts per million29). The 6 subjects who exceeded this criterion were counted as smokers.\n",

The statistical significance of mean differences in baseline subject characteristics was determined with chi-squared tests (for dichotomous varables) and one-way analyses of variance (for continuous variables).\n*Unadjusted P < .01 (no longer significant when corrected for number of tests performed; none of the other differences between conditions in baseline characteristics approached statistical significance prior to adjustment).\nsive promotion of this service, was not unexpected. The proportion of eligible smokers using reactive help lines has been shown, on occasion, to be quite small (on the order of 1% to 2%)3 ; in some studies, however, the proportion using help lines has been far greater.'4\"16 Both short-term and longer term abstinence rates are encouraging, despite the lack of differences between conditions.1 Adherence to use of nicotine patches generally was quite good. Nonetheless, and despite extensive training provided to telephone counselors, telephone calls failed to enhance abstinence outcomes. Perhaps the distribution of free patches was a factor. Subjects may have enrolled in the study in anticipation of receiving the patch at no cost and may not have been interested in other treatment components; thus, they may have been poor candidates for the telephone support.34 Yet subjects were receptive to telephone calls and tended to rate them as helpful to their efforts to quit smoking. The failure of subjects to use the support services suggests that offering this type of reactive helpline maybe of only very limited value.\nThe requirements for participation in the current study were more stringent than those for participation inmost previous telephone intervention studies. Of a potential pool of 912 subjects, 403 (44%) were eliminated from the study, 68 (17%) because they were currently taking antidepressants. Furthermore, unlike the casein most prior telephone interventions, subjects were required to attend a face-to-face orientation session and to rate themselves as motivated to quit (although only 5% of those eliminated were excluded on the basis of low motivation). Perhaps the proactive telephone outreach would have been more effective with a broader spectrum of potential quitters.  nation between assessment and intervention.\nThe conditions selected for evaluation in the current study were limited. All included a rather intensive face-to-face orientation session. Neither placebo patch nor telephone-only conditions (without face-to-face contact) were included. The lack of outcome differences between the conditions tested does not necessarily indicate that telephone outreach is ineffective; rather, its effectiveness was not demonstrated in the present context. Thus, the current study should not be considered definitive in terms of addressing the question of whether telephone support is an important adjunct to transdermal nicotine delivery systems.\nFurther work is needed to determine whether the type of group format used in the current study is superior to individual physician or other medical practitioner advice. Additional studies also may shed light on issues of optimal pricing of nicotine replacement, as well as the appropriate format and content of behavioral interventions, so as to produce optimal compliance and abstinence outcomes.
