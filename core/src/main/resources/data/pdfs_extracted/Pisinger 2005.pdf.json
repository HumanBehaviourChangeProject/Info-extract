Two thousand four hundred eight daily smokers in all motivational stages were actively recruited and included in a randomised population-based intervention study in Copenhagen, Denmark. All smokers completed a questionnaire and underwent a health examination and a lifestyle consultation. Daily smokers in the high intensity intervention group were offered assistance to quit in smoking cessation groups. Results. The validated abstinence rate at 1-year follow-up was 16.3% in the high intensity group and 12.7% in the low intensity group compared with a self-reported abstinence rate of 7.3% in the background population. The adjusted odds ratio of abstinence in the high intervention group was significantly higher, OR = 2.2 (1.6-3.0) than in the background population, also in the 'intention-to-treat' analyses, OR = 1.5 (1.1-2.0). Higher socioeconomic status, higher age at onset of daily smoking, and a higher wish to quit were predictors of success. Conclusion. Ina population-based setting, using active recruitment and offering assistance to quit, it was possible to include many smokers and to achieve a significantly higher validated abstinence in the high intensity intervention than in the background population, even when using 'intention-to-treat' analyses.",

      "value": "Smoking cessation interventions can be classified by their recruitment strategies. In the reactive recruitment strategy, the smokers must actively contact the programme or smoking cessation clinic to receive assistance to quit. This strategy appeals to the highly motivated and welleducated smokers, and results in low participation rates, but can achieve high abstinence rates. The proactive recruitment strategy recruits smokers in an active way by offering assistance to quit, for example, self-help manuals or physicians' advice to quit. These programmes can reach a large percentage of the population, but the abstinence rates are low. The challenge is to draw on the experience of both strategies, combining the high participation rates of the proactive strategies with the high abstinence rates of the reactive strategies.\nMany large and well-conducted community interventions studies have failed to detect an effect on prevalence of smoking. Interpersonal communication appears to bean important catalyst of community programs, and its inclusion should be emphasised to obtain a higher impact.\nInter99 (abbreviation of Intervention 1999) is a large population-based intervention study. The smoking intervention tries to combine the proactive recruitment strategy by sending a personal invitation with a prearranged date and time, with the reactive strategy, by offering an intensive smoking intervention to achieve a high impact. In previous papers, we have described a high recruitment rate of smokers in all stages of motivation, high acceptance of the smoking cessation groups, and high abstinence rates after the smoking cessation groups.\nThe aim of this paper was to report the abstinence rates after 1 year and compare them with abstinence rates in the background population and to compare the high intensity intervention with the low intensity intervention. We also wanted to investigate predictors of abstinence in the study population.\n",

The study is at Research Centre for Prevention and Health, Glostrup University Hospital, Copenhagen. The Copenhagen County Ethical Committee and the Danish Health Board have approved the study. The aim of the study is to prevent cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes by nonpharmacological intervention, that is, through change of lifestyle. We focused on changes in smoking, diet, and physical activity. The study population was randomly selected within age strata (30 -60 years) from a defined area of the suburb of Copenhagen. The individuals were drawn from the Civil Registration System in which a unique 10-digit number registers all inhabitants in Denmark, making linkage across time and registers very accurate. The subjects were prerandomised into one of three groups: a high intensity intervention group A (n = 11,708), a low intensity intervention group B (n = 1,308), and a nonintervention group C (n = 48,285). Group A was almost 10 times larger than group B, as we wanted mainly to test the effect of a high intensity intervention on long-term endpoints, such as cardiovascular disease. Group B was invited to test the intensity of the intervention on intermediate endpoints, such as change in smoking habits. More 40-to 50-yearold persons were invited in study groups A and B as the highest impact of the intervention was expected among the middle-aged. A random sample of 5,264 persons in group C, equally distributed within the age strata, served as control group and received questionnaires at baseline and after 1, 3, and 5 years to register spontaneous lifestyle changes in the background population. The study design is described in detail elsewhere.\nEighty-two of the persons in group AB were noneligible. The remaining 12,934 individuals in groups A and B received a personal invitation with a prearranged date and time of a consultation. Those who did not answer the first letter received anew invitation and those who still did not answer or said that they would not participate were sent a two-page nonresponder questionnaire. A total of 6,906 (53.4%) turned up for the investigation. Of these, 122 were excluded either due to alcoholism or drug abuse (n = 23) or because of linguistic problems (n = 99), leaving 6,784 (52.5%) for analyses. In general, the participation rate was higher in younger women than in younger men, and it increased with increasing age until 55 years of age after which it declined. Participation rate in groups A and B was identical. In group C, the participation rate was 63.1% (n = 3,324) with the same trend in age and sex difference as in groups A and B.\nOn the day of attendance in the clinic, all participants completed questionnaires, underwent a medical health examination, and were given an individual cardiovascular risk assessment with a computerised programme PRE-CARDR and a lifestyle consultation. The criteria for identifying persons at high risk of cardiovascular disease were a high total risk and isolated risk factors (high cholesterol, high systolic blood pressure, high body mass index, and daily smoking). This is described in detail in a previous article.\nThe smokers in the study A total of 2,408 daily smokers were included at baseline: 2,168 in group A and 240 in group B). All daily smokers were offered follow-up after 1, 3, and 5 years. The interventions after 1 and 3 years were identical with the intervention at baseline. Sixteen smokers had died or emigrated at 1-year follow-up, and 1,387 (57.6%) showed up. In the background population, 16 of the 1,276 daily smokers at baseline had died or emigrated, and 1,005 (78.8%) returned questionnaires at 1-year follow-up.\n",

Smokers were categorised in motivational stages using a simplified typology of Prochaska and Di Clemente. Preparation stage was defined as 'planning to quit within 1 month'. Contemplation stage was defined as 'planning to quit within the next 6 months'. Precontemplation stage was defined as 'not planning to quit'. Another measure of motivation to quit was the simple question 'wish to quit' (very much, much, only a little, not at all).\nThe likelihood of abstinence in the near future was measured by the variable 'how likely is it that you would achieve abstinence if you tried to quit in the near future'?

The consultation that lasted 15 -45 min was based on motivational interviewing and was a dialogue with the smoker, taking into account the smoker's wishes, pervious quit experiences, resources, and life situation. All daily smokers received a personalised smoking consultation depending on their motivation to quit, complementary samples of nicotine products of their own choice, and a self-help pamphlet.

The 1-year validated abstinence rate among those who attended 1-year follow-up tended to be higher in high intensity intervention group A than in low intensity group B, but the difference was not significant. The adjusted odds ratio for abstinence, when using the worst-case 'intention-to-treat' analyses, was significantly higher in the intervention group A but not in group B compared with the background population C. The difference seems clinically relevant. Higher socioeconomic status, higher age at onset of daily smoking, and a higher wish to quit were predictors of success.\nParticipation in smoking cessation groups increased the likelihood of long-term abstinence more than four times, but there was no statistically significant difference between the quit rates in groups A and B. However, a trend was seen, indicating higher quit rates in high intensity group A. The participation rates at baseline and 1-year follow-up were lower than we expected in our power calculations, which resulted in low power and difficulties to detect a difference between groups A and B. Therefore, after 1 year of intervention, we were notable to make conclusions on the optimal intensity of a smoking cessation program. It is important to answer the question of intensity of a smoking cessation program. If a minimal intervention can result in even a small increase in cessation rates, this would have a large public health impact.\nIna previous article, being a man, having a higher age, and higher socioeconomic status were predictors of 17-week continuous abstinence after participation in a smoking cessation group, whereas living with a smoking spouse and having a high nicotine dependence predicted failure. In this paper, we present point abstinence at 1 year among all smokers irrespective of their participation in smoking cessation groups or not. The only variable that significantly predicted abstinence both after a smoking cessation group (short-term) and at 1-year visit (long-term) was a high socioeconomic status. More than 1 year of vocational training and having a job increased the probability of abstinence five times after 1 year. This is in accordance with other studies. Smokers with the lowest socioeconomic status accepted the smoking cessation groups, but the intervention could not obliterate the social differences in ability to achieve abstinence. A simple wish to quit was a stronger predictor of abstinence than the 'stage of change'. This indicates that the smoking counsellor was able to give some of the smokers in early motivational stages inspiration and tools for quitting. It is interesting and conflicting with the 'Health Belief Model' that a high PRECARDR risk score, the calculated cardiovascular risk of each individual, did not predict participation in smoking cessation groups. This might indicate that a threat alone is not enough fora person to try to quit smoking. It might also be due to the fact that this variable does not reflect the subject's idea of the personal risk but only the calculated 'theoretical risk'. Potentially misclassified nonsmokers are found to deviate strongly from other nonsmokers with respect to mortality and morbidity, so validation of smoking status is essential. A metaanalysis concluded that self-reports of smoking are accurate inmost studies, but biochemical assessment should be considered in intervention studies. In the Lung Health Study (LHS) including almost 4,000 smokers, the error in self-report was very low, between 3% and 5% in the first year of follow-up. The frequent carbon monoxide measurements in the LHS have probably reduced the error in self-report at 1-year visit. In our study, the misclassification rate was much higher-16.0%-but low compared with a controlled antismoking trial in general practice of same size as our study, with misclassification rates between 24% and 40%.\nAt end of the smoking cessation groups, we reported a sustained abstinence rate of 35%. In this paper, we present point abstinence rates between 19% and 9% and an assumed decrease in smoking prevalence by about 1% point. The decreasing rates are an expression of inclusion of a more unselected smoking population and represent a more 'true' picture if we look at smoking cessation from a population-based perspective. Population-based or community-based interventions include smokers in all stages of motivation and reflect 'real life' in a population. The quit rates in the large population-based smoking cessation interventions from the 1990s were typically of 10% or less and were most often self-reported and not adjusted for those lost or not willing to participate at follow-up. In our study, the self-reported nonvalidated quit rate was 19% in group A and 16% in group B. When diluting the analyses with all nonattending persons and nonmotivated smokers and presenting 'intention-to-treat' results-assuming that nonparticipants do not change their smoking habit-a much more limited effect must be expected. 'Intention-to-treat' results should be presented in all studies to show not only the efficacy, but also the efficiency of atrial, but only few of the large smoking cessation studies have reported these results. In some of the studies, the abstinence rates remained significant after inclusion of nonparticipants at follow-up, but not in all. In the OXCHECK study, the quit rates were not significant, and when efficiency analyses were used, the abstinence rates were even lower than in the control group. This illustrates that we probably make an overadjustment when we assume that all nonparticipants remain smokers, and thereby present the 'worst case' results. No trials, as far as we know, have tried to compare the entire invited populations. Our study showed a little positive effect, but significance tests were not performed, and the results must be interpreted cautiously. More calculations will be done at the 5-year follow-up.\nAcceptance of and participation in a smoking cessation group increased the likelihood of abstinence at 1 year, even when we adjusted for motivation to quit at baseline. The study was not designed to answer which component of the smoking cessation groups was the most effective. The intensive use of nicotine replacement therapy probably increased the quit rates, but the behavioural therapy and the setting in the group of smokers have presumably contributed to this increase.\nIt seems that the higher the intensity of the intervention, the higher the cessation rates. Intensive smoking cessation programmes of this character are expensive. Therefore, it is of great importance to discuss the costs -benefit and feasibility of a program like this. The Inter99 study is a 5-year multifactorial intervention on smoking, diet, and exercise. The smoking intervention is only one part of the study. The cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and impact of the whole study will be described thoroughly at end of the trial.\n",
