Study design  For this cluster randomized controlled trial, 18 childcare centers were randomly allocated in equal numbers to the typical curriculum comparison group, childcare intervention alone (CC), or childcare intervention with parental involvement. Accelerometers were used to asses physical activity and sedentary time, and body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance.    Results  Linear mixed model regression analyses showed no differences between the CC, the childcare intervention with parental involvement, and the comparison groups in changes from baseline to 6 months in total physical activity ( P  for time × group interaction = .665) or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( P  for time × group interaction = .164) when adjusted for baseline physical activity levels. Furthermore, no group differences were found for changes in light physical activity, sedentary time, or anthropometric variables.    Conclusions  An affordable and easily scalable preschool intervention program delivered in licensed childcare settings, with or without the addition of a parent-driven home physical activity promotion, seems to have no significant effect on physical activity, sedentary time, or body composition.

To evaluate the impact of a faith-based intervention to promote physical activity in Latinas.Methods. We randomized 16 churches in San Diego County, California, to a physical activity intervention or cancer screening comparison condition (n = 436). The intervention followed an ecological framework and involved promotoras. We examined 12-month intervention effects, including accelerometer-based moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA; primary outcome) and secondary outcomes. We conducted the study from 2010 to 2016.Results. Mixed effects analyses showed significant increases in accelerometer-based MVPA (effect size = 0.25) and self-report leisure-time MVPA (effect size = 0.38) among Latinas in the intervention versus comparison condition. Participants in the intervention condition had about 66% higher odds of meeting the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines, had reduced body mass index (effect size = 0.23), and used more behavioral strategies for engaging in physical activity (effect size = 0...","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Arredondo Elva M; Elder John P; Haughton Jessica ; Slymen Donald J; Sallis James F; Perez Lilian G; Serrano Natalicio ; Parra Maíra T; Valdivia Rodrigo ; Ayala Guadalupe X; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2017.303785","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Arredondo Elva M, Elder John P, Haughton Jessica, Slymen Donald J, Sallis James F, Perez Lilian G, Serrano Natalicio, Parra Maíra T, Valdivia Rodrigo, and Ayala Guadalupe X (2017) Fe en Acción: Promoting Physical Activity Among Churchgoing Latinas..

 Adherence to physical activity (PA) recommendations is hampered by the lack of effective strategies to promote behavior change. The Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study_2 is a randomized controlled trial evaluating a novel behavioral intervention strategy for increasing PA and decreasing sedentary time (SED-time) in patients with type 2 diabetes.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  The study randomized 300 physically inactive and sedentary patients with type 2 diabetes 1:1 to receive theoretical and practical counseling once yearly for 3 years (intervention group [INT]) or standard care (control group [CON]). Here, we report the 4-month effects on objectively (accelerometer) measured daily light-intensity PA (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous–intensity PA (MVPA), and SED-time, and cardiovascular risk factors.  RESULTS  LPA and MVPA both increased, and SED-time decreased in both groups, although changes were significantly more marked in INT participants (approximately twofold for LPA and SED-time and approximately sixfold for MVPA). A significant reduction in HbA 1c  was observed only in INT subjects. An increase in LPA >0.92 h · day −1  and in MVPA >7.33 min · day −1  and a decrease in SED-time >1.05 h · day −1  were associated with a average decrease in HbA 1c  of ∼1% and also with significant improvements in fasting glucose, body weight, waist circumference, and hs-CRP. Changes in PA and SED-time were independent predictors of improvements in HbA 1c .  CONCLUSIONS  This behavioral intervention is effective in the short-term for increasing LPA and MVPA and reducing SED-time. Significant improvements in cardiometabolic risk profiles were observed in subjects experiencing the most pronounced changes in PA and SED-time, even if below the recommended level.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Balducci Stefano ; D’Errico Valeria ; Haxhi Jonida ; Sacchetti Massimo ; Orlando Giorgio ; Cardelli Patrizia ; Vitale Martina ; Bollanti Lucilla ; Conti Francesco ; Zanuso Silvano ; Nicolucci Antonio ; Pugliese Giuseppe ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2337/DC17-0594","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Balducci Stefano, D’Errico Valeria, Haxhi Jonida, Sacchetti Massimo, Orlando Giorgio, Cardelli Patrizia, Vitale Martina, Bollanti Lucilla, Conti Francesco, Zanuso Silvano, Nicolucci Antonio, and Pugliese Giuseppe (2017) Effect of a Behavioral Intervention Strategy for Adoption and Maintenance of a Physically Active Lifestyle: The Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study 2 (IDES_2): A Randomized Controlled Trial..

 Video games designed to promote behavior change are a promising venue to enable children to learn healthier behaviors.  Purpose  Evaluate outcome from playing \"Escape from Diab\" (Diab) and \"Nanoswarm: Invasion from Inner Space\" (Nano) video games on children's diet, physical activity, and adiposity.  Design  Two-group RCT; assessments occurred at baseline, immediately after Diab, immediately after Nano, and 2 months later. Data were collected in 2008–2009, and analyses were conducted in 2009–2010.  Setting/participants  133 children aged 10–12 years, initially between 50th percentile and 95th percentile BMI.  Intervention  Treatment group played Diab and Nano in sequence. Control Group played diet and physical activity knowledge-based games on popular websites.  Main outcome measures  Servings of fruit, vegetable, and water; minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity. At each point of assessment: 3 nonconsecutive days of 24-hour dietary recalls; 5 consecutive days of physical activity using accelerometers; and assessment of height, weight, waist circumference, and triceps skinfold.  Results  A repeated measures ANCOVA was conducted (analyzed in 2009–2010).

of this study was to determine whether a twelve-week, health coaching intervention could result in changes in physical activity, anthropometrics and health-related outcomes in adults presenting to an ambulatory hospital clinic. Seventy-two participants who reported being insufficiently active were recruited from an ambulatory hospital clinic and randomised to an intervention group that received an education session and eight 30-min telephone sessions of integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behaviour therapy (MI-CBT), or to a control group that received the education session only. ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers were used to measure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at baseline, post-intervention (3-months) and follow-up (6-months). Secondary outcome measures (anthropometrics, physical activity self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, type 2 diabetes risk) were also assessed at the three time points. At baseline, the mean age and body mass index of participants (n = 72, 75% females) were 53 ± 8 years and 30.8 ± 4.1 kg/m2, respectively. Treatment group influenced the pattern of physical activity over time (p < 0.001). The intervention group increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity from baseline to post-intervention and remained elevated at follow-up by 12.9 min/day (95%CI: 6.5 to 19.5 min/day). In contrast, at follow-up the control group decreased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity by 9.9 min/day (95%CI: -3.7 to -16.0 min/day). Relative to control, at follow-up the intervention group exhibited beneficial changes in body mass (p < 0.001), waist circumference (p < 0.001), body mass index (p < 0.001), physical activity self-efficacy (p < 0.001), type 2 diabetes risk (p < 0.001), and health-related quality of life (p < 0.001). This study demonstrates that a low contact coaching intervention results in beneficial changes in physical activity, anthropometrics and health-related outcomes that were maintained at follow-up in adults who report being insufficiently active to an ambulatory care clinic.

Despite the vast amount of research published in the field of PA interventions, little attention has been given to individuals with MD.  Objective  The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of an app-based versus a supervised exercise and health coaching program to support adults with MD to increase levels of PA, CRF, and improve body composition.  Methods  Participants with self-perceived MD, aged 18 to 45 years, were included in this 12-week parallel-group randomized controlled trial and allocated at random to an app-based intervention, using commercially available apps-the Swedish Military training app (FMTK), the Acupedo walking app, and the LogMyFood food photography app-or a supervised exercise and health coaching intervention, including 1 weekly supervised exercise session and healthy lifestyle coaching. The primary outcome was the level of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) measured with accelerometers. Secondary outcomes included CRF measured by a submaximal test performed on a stationary bicycle and body composition measured by bioelectrical impedance. All outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Linear mixed-effect models were used to assess the between-group differences, as well as the within-group changes through time, in each intervention group.  Results  A total of 110 participants with MD were randomized to an app-based intervention (n=55) or a supervised exercise and health intervention (n=55). The mean age of participants was 34.9 years (SD 6.1), and 81.8% (90/110) of the participants were women. CRF showed a moderate increase in both groups after 12 weeks-1.07 (95% CI -0.14 to 2.27) mL/kg/min increase in the app-based group and 1.76 (95% CI 0.70 to 2.83) mLkg/min increase in the supervised exercise group. However, the intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant differences between the groups in MVPA or CRF after 12 weeks. Waist circumference was significantly lower in the app-based intervention group.  Conclusions  Commercially available apps increased levels of CRF and improved body composition over 12 weeks to the same extent as supervised exercise sessions, showing that both are equally effective. However, neither the app-based intervention nor the supervised exercise intervention increased MVPA.

Exercise videogames may offer an attractive, sustainable alternative or supplement to traditional modes of exercise. This study compared exercise videogames with standard exercise modalities for improving uptake and maintenance of moderate to vigorous physical activity, and health risk indices.    Study design  A three-arm clinical RCT including 12 weeks of supervised laboratory-based moderate to vigorous physical activity followed by 6 months follow-up.    Setting/participants  This study was conducted at a university affiliated hospital research lab. Healthy, sedentary adults were eligible.    Interventions  This study compared a 12-week program of supervised exercise videogames versus standard exercise (e.g., treadmill) versus control. Data were collected from January 2012 to September 2017 and analyzed in 2018.    Main outcome measures  The primary outcome was weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity at end of treatment, assessed at 3 and 6 months post-intervention by using self-report and accelerometer data. Health risk indices (e.g., HbA1c, lipids) were also assessed.    Results  Participants (N=283) had an average age of 46.2 ±13.5 years; 79% were female. At end of treatment, those in the exercise videogame arm engaged in 30 minutes/week more moderate to vigorous physical activity compared with standard exercise and 85 more minutes/week than controls (all p    Conclusions  Exercise videogames produced greater uptake and maintenance of moderate to vigorous physical activity compared with standard exercise and improvements in multiple health risk indices. Exercise videogames may promote sustainable physical activity with significant health benefits.

However, parent-based treatment (PBT), which is provided to the parent without the child, could be similarly effective and easier to disseminate.  Objective  To determine whether PBT is similarly effective as FBT on child weight loss over 24 months. Secondary aims evaluated the effect of these 2 treatments on parent weight loss, child and parent dietary intake, child and parent physical activity, parenting style, and parent feeding behaviors.  Design, Setting, and Participants  Randomized 2-arm noninferiority trial conducted at an academic medical center, University of California, San Diego, between July 2011 and July 2015. Participants included 150 overweight and obese 8- to 12-year-old children and their parents.  Interventions  Both PBT and FBT were delivered in 20 one-hour group meetings with 30-minute individualized behavioral coaching sessions over 6 months. Treatments were similar in content; the only difference was the attendance of the child.  Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome measure was child weight loss (body mass index [BMI] and BMI z score) at 6, 12, and 18 months post treatment. Secondary outcomes were parent weight loss (BMI), child and parent energy intake, child and parent physical activity (moderate to vigorous physical activity minutes), parenting style, and parent feeding behaviors.  Results  One hundred fifty children (mean BMI, 26.4; mean BMI z score, 2.0; mean age, 10.4 years; 66.4% girls) and their parent (mean BMI, 31.9; mean age, 42.9 years; 87.3% women; and 31% Hispanic, 49% non-Hispanic white, and 20% other race/ethnicity) were randomly assigned to either FBT or PBT. Child weight loss after 6 months was −0.25 BMI z scores in both PBT and FBT. Intention-to-treat analysis using mixed linear models showed that PBT was noninferior to FBT on all outcomes at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up with a mean difference in child weight loss of 0.001 (95% CI, −0.06 to 0.06).  Conclusions and Relevance  Parent-based treatment was as effective on child weight loss and several secondary outcomes (parent weight loss, parent and child energy intake, and parent and child physical activity). Parent-based treatment is a viable model to provide weight loss treatment to children.

activity is important for weight management. However, it remains unclear what type of physical activity prescription/programme is optimal for increasing physical activity during a standard behavioural weight loss intervention. This study examined changes in physical activity after a 12-week supervised programme prescribed in minutes per week (SUP-PA), an unsupervised programme prescribed in minutes per week (UNSUP-PA) and an unsupervised programme prescribed in steps per day (STEP).\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nFifty-two adults who were overweight or obese (age: 43.5 ± 10.1 years, BMI: 31.5 ± 3.5 kg·m−2) were randomized to STEP (n = 18), UNSUP-PA (n = 17) and SUP-PA (n = 17). Subjects attended weekly in-person group intervention sessions and were prescribed a calorie-restricted diet (1,200–1,800 kcals·day−1) combined with increased physical activity (150 min·week−1 or 10,000 steps·day−1 with 2,500 brisk steps·day−1).\r\n\r\nResults\r\nAll three groups significantly increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (STEP: 80.6 ± 218.5 min·week−1, UNSUP-PA: 112.9 ± 180.4 min·week−1 and SUP-PA: 151.1 ± 174.0 min·week−1, p < 0.001) with no differences between groups (p = 0.94) or group by time interaction (p = 0.81). In addition, there were no significant differences in weight loss between the groups (p = 0.81).\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nIn this short-term study, all three physical activity programmes increased physical activity and elicited modest weight loss when combined with a standard behavioural weight loss intervention.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Creasy S A; Rogers R J; Davis K K; Gibbs B B; Kershaw E E; Jakicic J M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/OSP4.107","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Creasy S A, Rogers R J, Davis K K, Gibbs B B, Kershaw E E, and Jakicic J M (2017) Effects of supervised and unsupervised physical activity programmes for weight loss..

This study evaluated whether a social and gamified smartphone app (Active Team) could be one such approach.    Study design  A 3-group cluster RCT compared the efficacy of Active Team with a basic self-monitoring app and waitlist control group.    Setting/participants  Australian adults (N=444, mean age of 41 years, 74% female) were recruited in teams (n=121) and randomly assigned (1:1:1) to the Active Team (n=141, 39 teams), self-monitoring app (n=160, 42 teams), or waitlist group (n=143, 40 teams). Data were collected in 2016–2017, and analysis was conducted in 2018–2019.    Intervention  Active Team is a 100-day app-based, gamified, online social networking physical activity intervention.    Main outcome measures  The primary outcome was change in objective physical activity from baseline to 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included objective physical activity at 9 months and self-reported physical activity, quality of life, depression, anxiety and stress, well-being, and engagement.    Results  Mixed models indicated no significant differences in objective physical activity between groups at 3 (F=0.17, p=0.84; Cohen's d=0.03, 95% CI= −0.21, 0.26) or 9 months (F=0.23, p=0.92; d=0.06, 95% CI= −0.17, 0.29) and no significant differences for secondary outcomes of quality of life, depression, anxiety and stress, or well-being. Self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was significantly higher in the Active Team group at the 9-month follow-up (F=3.05, p=0.02; d=0.50, 95% CI=0.26, 0.73). Engagement was high; the Active Team group logged steps on an average of 72 (SD=35) days and used the social and gamified features an average of 89 (SD=118) times.    Conclusions  A gamified, online social networking physical activity intervention did not change objective moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, though it did increase self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and achieve high levels of engagement. Future work is needed to understand if gamification, online social networks, and app-based approaches can be leveraged to achieve positive behavior change.    Trial registration  This study is registered at Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (protocol: ANZCTR12617000113358).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Edney Sarah M; Olds Tim S; Ryan Jillian C; Vandelanotte Corneel ; Plotnikoff Ronald C; Curtis Rachel G; Maher Carol A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.AMEPRE.2019.09.009","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Edney Sarah M, Olds Tim S, Ryan Jillian C, Vandelanotte Corneel, Plotnikoff Ronald C, Curtis Rachel G, and Maher Carol A (2020) A Social Networking and Gamified App to Increase Physical Activity: Cluster RCT.

OBJECTIVE The goal of the research was to determine the effectiveness of a 3-month behavior change program delivered via a mobile phone app to promote AT (TravelVu Plus) on time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). METHODS For this 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial, we recruited a population-based sample of 254 adults from Stockholm County who were aged 20 to 65 years and had access to a smartphone. On completion of 1-week baseline measures, the 254 participants were randomized to either the control or intervention group (1:1 ratio). Both groups had access to the standard TravelVu app (Trivector AB) for monitoring their AT for 6 months. The intervention group also received a 3-month behavior change program to promote AT (TravelVu Plus app). Assessors of outcomes were blinded to group allocation. Outcomes were objectively measured MVPA at 3 (primary) and 6 months. Secondary outcomes were AT, attitudes toward AT, and health-related quality of life at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS No effect on MVPA was observed after 3 months (P=.29); however, at 6 months the intervention group had a greater improvement in MVPA than the controls (6.05 minutes per day [95% CI 0.36 to 11.74; P=.04]). A Bayesian analyses showed that there was a 98% probability that the intervention had any effect at 6 months, and a 63% probability that this effect was >5 minute MVPA per day. CONCLUSIONS No effect on MVPA immediately after the intervention period (at 3 months) was observed; however, there was a delayed effect on MVPA (6 minutes per day) at 6 months, which corresponds to approximately 30% of the weekly MVPA recommendation. Our findings suggest that a behavior change program promoting AT delivered via an app may have a relevant effect on PA.

main objective in the current study was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness (12 months from baseline) of I Move (a web-based computer tailored physical activity intervention, based on self-determination theory and motivational interviewing). To this end, we compared I Move to a web-based computer tailored physical activity intervention based on traditional health behavior theories (Active Plus), and to a no-intervention control group. As a secondary objective, the present study aimed to identify participant characteristics that moderate the long term effects of I Move and Active Plus. A randomized controlled trial was conducted, comparing three research conditions: 1) the I Move condition, participants in this condition received I Move; 2) the Active Plus condition, participants in this condition received Active Plus; 3) the control condition; participants in this condition received no intervention and were placed on a waiting list. Main outcome measures were weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity and weekly days with minimal 30 min of physical activity. All measurements were taken by web-based questionnaires via the study website. Intervention effects were analyzed using multilevel linear regression analyses. At 12 months from baseline, I Move was found to be effective in increasing weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (ES = .13), while Active Plus was not. In contrast, Active Plus was found to be effective in increasing weekly days with ≥ 30 min PA at 12 months (ES = .11), while I Move was not. No moderators of the effects of I Move were found. The results suggest that web-based computer tailored physical activity interventions might best include elements based on both self-determination theory/motivational interviewing and traditional health behavioral theories. To be more precise, it is arguable that the focus of the theoretical foundations, used in new web-based PA interventions should depend on the intended program outcome. In order to draw firm conclusions, however, more research on the effects of self-determination theory and motivational interviewing in web-based physical activity promotion is needed.

activity (PA) is beneficial in improving negative physical and psychological effects of cancer and cancer treatment, but adherence to PA guidelines is low. Computer-tailored PA interventions can reach large populations with little resources. They match with patients’ preference for home-based, unsupervised PA programs and are thus promising for the growing population of cancer survivors. The current study assessed the efficacy of a computer-tailored PA intervention in (four subgroups of) prostate and colorectal cancer survivors. Prostate and colorectal cancer patients and survivors were randomized to the OncoActive intervention group (N = 249), or a usual-care waiting-list control group (N = 229). OncoActive participants received a pedometer and computer-tailored PA advice, both Web-based via an interactive website and with printed materials. Minutes moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and days ≥30 min PA were assessed with an accelerometer (ActiGraph) at baseline and 6 months. Further, questionnaires were used to assess self-reported PA, fatigue, distress, and quality of life at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Differences between both groups were assessed using linear regression analyses (complete cases and intention-to-treat). In addition, efficacy in relation to age, gender, education, type of cancer, and time since treatment was examined. Three months after baseline OncoActive participants significantly increased their self-reported PA (PA days: d = 0.46; MVPA: d = 0.23). Physical functioning (d = 0.23) and fatigue (d = − 0.21) also improved significantly after three months. Six months after baseline, self-reported PA (PA days: d = 0.51; MVPA: d = 0.37) and ActiGraph MVPA (d = 0.27) increased significantly, and ActiGraph days (d = 0.16) increased borderline significantly (p = .05; d = 0.16). Furthermore, OncoActive participants reported significantly improvements in physical functioning (d = 0.14), fatigue (d = − 0.23) and depression (d = − 0.32). Similar results were found for intention-to-treat analyses. Higher increases in PA were found for colorectal cancer participants at 3 months, and for medium and highly educated participants’ PA at 6 months. Health outcomes at 6 months were more prominent in colorectal cancer participants and in women. The OncoActive intervention was effective at increasing PA in prostate and colorectal cancer patients and survivors. Health-related effects were especially apparent in colorectal cancer participants. The intervention provides opportunities to accelerate cancer recovery. Long-term follow-up should examine further sustainability of these effects.

been hypothesised that an ‘activitystat’ may biologically regulate energy expenditure or physical activity levels, thereby limiting the effectiveness of physical activity interventions. Using a randomised controlled trial design, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a six-week exercise stimulus on energy expenditure and physical activity, in order to empirically test this hypothesis. Previously inactive adults (n = 129) [age (mean ± SD) 41 ± 11 year; body mass index 26.1 ± 5.2 kg/m2] were randomly allocated to a Control group (n = 43) or a 6-week Moderate (150 min/week) (n = 43) or Extensive (300 min/week) (n = 43) exercise intervention group. Energy expenditure and physical activity were measured using a combination of accelerometry (total counts, minutes spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity) and detailed time use recalls using the Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adults (total daily energy expenditure, minutes spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity) at baseline, mid- and end-intervention and 3- and 6-month follow up. Resting metabolic rate was measured at baseline and end-intervention using indirect calorimetry. Analysis was conducted using random effects mixed modeling. At end-intervention, there were statistically significant increases in all energy expenditure and physical activity variables according to both accelerometry and time use recalls (p < 0.001) in the Moderate and Extensive groups, relative to Controls. There was no significant change in resting metabolic rate (p = 0.78). Taken together, these results show no evidence of an “activitystat” effect. In the current study, imposed exercise stimuli of 150–300 min/week resulted in commensurate increases in overall energy expenditure and physical activity, with no sign of compensation in either of these constructs.

METHODS  Three schools were randomly selected by an intervention group in Bogota, Colombia, in 2013: Intervention (Active Module of Active Recess – MARA) + Text Messages (SMS) (MARA+SMS group), intervention (MARA group), control (control group). Intervention was implemented for ten weeks. The duration and intensity of physical activity and sedentary behaviors were measured objectively using accelerometers Actigraph-GT3X+. Adiposity was measured by body mass index and fat percentage. We measured at baseline (T0) and during the tenth week of intervention (T1). We evaluated the effect of the intervention using a difference-in-difference analysis (DID).  RESULTS  We included 120 students (57.5% girls; mean age = 10.5 years; standard deviation [SD] = 0.64). There was a significant increase in the mean daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity in the MARA group (Difference T1-T0 = 6.1 minutes, standard error [SE] = 3.49, p = 0.005) in relation to the control group. There were no significant changes in the minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity in the MARA+SMS group (Difference T1-T0 = -1.0 minute; SE = 3.06; p = 0.363). The minutes decreased in the control group (Difference T1-T0 = -7.7 minutes; SE = 3.15; p = 0.011). The minutes of sedentary behaviors decreased in the MARA and MARA+SMS groups and increased in the control group (MARA Difference T1-T0 = -15.8 minutes; SE = 10.05; p= 0.279; MARA+SMS Difference T1-T0 = -11.5 minutes; SE = 8.80; p= 0.869; Control Difference T1-T0 = 10.9 minutes; SE = 9.07; p = 0.407). There was a higher participation in the MARA group in relation to the MARA+SMS group (MARA group = 34.4%; MARA+SMS group = 12.1%). There were no significant changes in adiposity at 10 weeks according to difference-in-differences analysis (body mass index p: ΔMARA+SMS group versus Δcontrol group = 0.945, ΔMARA group versus Δcontrol group = 0.847, ΔMARA+SMS group versus ΔMARA group = 0.990; FP p ΔMARA+SMS group versus Δcontrol group = 0.788, ΔMARA group versus Δcontrol group = 0.915, ΔMARA+SMS group versus ΔMARA group = 0.975).  CONCLUSIONS  The Active Module of Active Recess is a promising strategy to increase physical activity levels and decrease sedentary behavior in students. The addition of Text Messages was not associated with increased moderate to vigorous physical activity or changes in adiposity.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gutiérrez-Martínez Leidys ; Martínez Rocío Gámez; González Silvia A; González Silvia A; Bolívar Manuel A; Estupiñan Omaira Valencia; Sarmiento Olga L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.11606/S1518-8787.2018052017173","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gutiérrez-Martínez Leidys, Martínez Rocío Gámez, González Silvia A, González Silvia A, Bolívar Manuel A, Estupiñan Omaira Valencia, and Sarmiento Olga L (2018) Effects of a strategy for the promotion of physical activity in students from Bogotá..

Effective physical activity interventions are needed for children because health behaviors track into adulthood, and risk factors for diseases begin early in life. No study has determined whether an intervention designed using a Community-Based Participatory Research approach can improve moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and the related psychosocial constructs in underserved children. This study determined whether improvements in MVPA and related psychosocial constructs (self-efficacy, knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and skills) occurred following a Community-Based Participatory Research intervention in underserved, rural children. It was then determined if these constructs were mediators of MVPA. METHODS Two fifth-grade classes at a school (n = 19 and n = 20) were randomly assigned to an intervention or comparison group. The intervention group participated in a 4-week intervention designed to improve MVPA (wGT3X-BT accelerometer; ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) and the related psychosocial constructs (written survey). Groups were assessed prior to and immediately following the intervention. RESULTS There were no differences at baseline between groups. MVPA (30.0 [4.4] min), knowledge, and skill scores were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the comparison group at follow-up (P < .05). Knowledge and skills were mediating variables of MVPA. CONCLUSIONS Priority should be placed on research that determines the sustained impact of similar Community-Based Participatory Research interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hamilton Kara C; Richardson Mark T; McGraw Shanda ; Owens Teirdre ; Higginbotham John C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1123/JPAH.2019-0135","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hamilton Kara C, Richardson Mark T, McGraw Shanda, Owens Teirdre, and Higginbotham John C (2020) A Controlled Evaluation of a CBPR Intervention's Effects on Physical Activity and the Related Psychosocial Constructs Among Minority Children in an Underserved Community..

There is a need for effective, scalable interventions to promote activity. Self-monitoring by pedometer is a potentially suitable strategy. We assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a very brief (5-minute) pedometer-based intervention (‘Step It Up’) delivered as part of National Health Service (NHS) Health Checks in primary care.   Methods and findings The Very Brief Intervention (VBI) Trial was a two parallel-group, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 3-month follow-up, conducted in 23 primary care practices in the East of England. Participants were 1,007 healthy adults aged 40 to 74 years eligible for an NHS Health Check. They were randomly allocated (1:1) using a web-based tool between October 1, 2014, and December 31, 2015, to either intervention (505) or control group (502), stratified by primary care practice. Participants were aware of study group allocation. Control participants received the NHS Health Check only. Intervention participants additionally received Step It Up: a 5-minute face-to-face discussion, written materials, pedometer, and step chart. The primary outcome was accelerometer-based physical activity volume at 3-month follow-up adjusted for sex, 5-year age group, and general practice. Secondary outcomes included time spent in different intensities of physical activity, self-reported physical activity, and economic measures. We conducted an in-depth fidelity assessment on a subsample of Health Check consultations. Participants’ mean age was 56 years, two-thirds were female, they were predominantly white, and two-thirds were in paid employment. The primary outcome was available in 859 (85.3%) participants. There was no significant between-group difference in activity volume at 3 months (adjusted intervention effect 8.8 counts per minute [cpm]; 95% CI −18.7 to 36.3; p = 0.53). We found no significant between-group differences in the secondary outcomes of step counts per day, time spent in moderate or vigorous activity, time spent in vigorous activity, and time spent in moderate-intensity activity (accelerometer-derived variables); as well as in total physical activity, home-based activity, work-based activity, leisure-based activity, commuting physical activity, and screen or TV time (self-reported physical activity variables). Of the 505 intervention participants, 491 (97%) received the Step it Up intervention. Analysis of 37 intervention consultations showed that 60% of Step it Up components were delivered faithfully. The intervention cost £18.04 per participant. Incremental cost to the NHS per 1,000-step increase per day was £96 and to society was £239. Adverse events were reported by 5 intervention participants (of which 2 were serious) and 5 control participants (of which 2 were serious). The study’s limitations include a participation rate of 16% and low return of audiotapes by practices for fidelity assessment.   Conclusions In this large well-conducted trial, we found no evidence of effect of a plausible very brief pedometer intervention embedded in NHS Health Checks on objectively measured activity at 3-month follow-up.

Whether a generic or tailored approach to weight management is needed for cancer survivors has yet to be tested. PROCEDURE Thirty-eight youth 8-18 years with BMI ≥ 85% who had survived ALL were recruited for a randomized clinical trial evaluating a weight management intervention (WMI) tailored for childhood ALL survivors (Fit4Life). Fit4Life recipients received a 4-month web, phone, and text message-delivered WMI tailored for cancer survivorship. Controls received a general WMI delivered via phone and mail. Assessments were performed at baseline and 4 months. Outcome data were analyzed according to assigned treatment condition over time. RESULTS Most (80%, (70%, 100%) [median (IQR)]) of the assigned curriculum was received by Fit4Life participants as compared to 50% (40%, 65%) among controls. Fit4Life recipients ≥ 14 years demonstrated less weight gain (P = 0.05) and increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (P < 0.01) while all Fit4Life recipients reported reduced negative mood (P < 0.05) over time as compared to control counterparts. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated acceptable feasibility of a WMI tailored for overweight and obese children surviving ALL utilizing a multimodal technology approach. Improved weight, weight-related behavior, and psychological outcomes were demonstrated among Fit4Life intervention as compared to youth receiving a generic WMI. Data from this pilot trial may be used to design a larger trial to determine whether youth of all ages also can derive a benefit from a cancer survivor-tailored WMI and whether short-term outcomes translate into improved long-term outcomes for childhood ALL survivors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Huang Jeannie S; Huang Jeannie S; Dillon Lindsay ; Terrones Laura ; Schubert Lynn ; Schubert Lynn ; Roberts William ; Roberts William ; Finklestein Jerry ; Swartz Maria C; Norman Gregory J; Patrick Kevin ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/PBC.24937","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Huang Jeannie S, Huang Jeannie S, Dillon Lindsay, Terrones Laura, Schubert Lynn, Schubert Lynn, Roberts William, Roberts William, Finklestein Jerry, Swartz Maria C, Norman Gregory J, and Patrick Kevin (2014) Fit4Life: a weight loss intervention for children who have survived childhood leukemia..

 The purpose of this investigation was to test the feasibility of a home-based moderate-intensity physical activity (MPA) program for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) currently taking antiretroviral therapy (ART).   Methods:  68 participants recruited for a 9-month home-based PA intervention aimed to reduce risk factors of cardiovascular disease for PLWHA taking ART. All participants received an educational weight loss workbook and a pedometer for self-monitoring of physical activity. The intervention group received elastic Therabands® for strength training in addition to telephone based behavioural coaching. Clinical assessments were conducted at baseline and each follow-up which also included psychometric questionnaires and PA levels via the SenseWear® armband accelerometer.   Results:  Of the 57 completing the study, 29 of those were in the intervention group and 28 were in the standard care group. Results show that the home-based PA intervention was not successful in increasing the total amount of MPA for PLWHA. However there was a trend (p=0.08) of decreasing sedentary time. In a secondary analysis those who increased PA by >10% observed decreases in waist circumference and improved functioning at 18 weeks. None of the changes observed were significant after controlling for all potential confounders.   Conclusions:  A home-based exercise approach with telephone-based coaching may not be a feasible method for increasing MPA among PLWHA. Slight decreases in sedentary time indicate some positive changes in activity habits. A possible strategy to improve studies similar to this is to incorporate a group based social interaction each week similar to that of a support group.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jaggers Jason R; Sneed Joanna M; Lobelo R L.

purpose of this study was to determine the utility of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) as a practical strategy for promoting exercise adherence in comparison with traditional moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICT). Inactive individuals with prediabetes ( M age   = 51±10) were randomly assigned to HIIT ( n  = 10) or MICT ( n  = 16)  involving 7 days of supervised training and 3 home sessions over a 2-week period. Exercise sessions for each condition were progressive in nature and matched for external work. Following the program, participants were instructed to maintain HIIT or MICT three days per week independently for one month. Exercise adherence was measured subjectively using training logs by calculating percentage adherence and objectively using accelerometers worn at baseline and one-month follow-up. Time spent in moderate and vigorous activity was calculated. Participants engaging in HIIT self-reported significantly greater adherence when compared to MICT  t (18.96) = 2.08,  p  = .05,  d  = 0.75. Accelerometer analyses revealed no statistical difference between conditions in total time spent in moderate activity at baseline or one-month follow-up ( p  > .05). However, there was a significant difference between the number of minutes spent in vigorous activity between conditions at one-month follow-up,  F (1, 20) = 4.41,  p  = .049,  d  = 0.92, with individuals engaging in HIIT engaging in more minutes of vigorous exercise than those in MICT. This feasibility study is the first to examine adherence to HIIT outside of a supervised laboratory setting and demonstrates that individuals with prediabetes can adhere to HIIT independently for one month following a very brief intervention. Adherence to HIIT, as assessed by self-report, was greater than standard care MICT. The greater amount of vigorous activity performed within the HIIT condition has potential clinical importance given the additional benefits of vigorous intensity physical activity over moderate physical activity for reducing cardiometabolic risk.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jung Mary E; Bourne Jessica E; Beauchamp Mark R; Little Jonathan P; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jung Mary E, Bourne Jessica E, Beauchamp Mark R, and Little Jonathan P (2014) High-intensity interval training versus continuous moderate-intensity training for promoting exercise adherence in individuals with prediabetes: A feasibility study.

Participants and Intervention  Youth aged 9–10 years and the main preparer of their meals participated in the 12-week program followed by monthly newsletters and biyearly booster sessions until 24 months.    Main Outcome Measure(s)  A total of 155 youth were fitted with an Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer, which they wore for 7 days at baseline and 4, 12, and 24 months to measure mean daily minutes per hour of waking wear time for sedentary time (ST), light physical activity (PA) (LPA), moderate PA, vigorous PA, and moderate to vigorous PA. Self-reported PA was assessed using the Block Kids Physical Activity Screener and additional questions querying for the program goal of the frequency of family actively playing together. Linear mixed models were used to determine differences from baseline to 24 months. Significance was set at P ≤ .05.    Results  There was a significant (P     Conclusions and Implications  iCook 4-H was a multicomponent program observing youth aged 9–10 years for 24 months that focused on enhancing cooking skills, mealtime behavior and conversation, and PA through daily family activities. Greater emphasis on developing PA skills, changing environmental factors, and increasing PA both in and after school may be needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kattelmann Kendra K; Meendering Jessica R; Hofer Emily J; Merfeld Chase M; Olfert Melissa D; Hagedorn Rebecca L; Colby Sarah E; Franzen-Castle Lisa ; Moyer Jonathan ; Mathews Douglas R; White Adrienne A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.JNEB.2018.09.002","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kattelmann Kendra K, Meendering Jessica R, Hofer Emily J, Merfeld Chase M, Olfert Melissa D, Hagedorn Rebecca L, Colby Sarah E, Franzen-Castle Lisa, Moyer Jonathan, Mathews Douglas R, and White Adrienne A (2019) The iCook 4-H Study: Report on Physical Activity and Sedentary Time in Youth Participating in a Multicomponent Program Promoting Family Cooking, Eating, and Playing Together..

Accelerometer-measured MVPA was measured over 7 days at baseline and again for 7 days immediately post-intervention.\r\nResults \r\nMinutes of MVPA increased significantly in the overall sample (p = 0.02); however, the effect of adding the pedometer to the education program was not significant (p = 0.89). Mean (±SE) MVPA increased from 12.7±2.4 min/day to 16.2±3.6 min/day in the education-only group and from 13.2±3.3 min/day to 16.3±3.9 min/day in the education+pedometer group. The correlation between change in steps/day and change in MVPA was 0.69 (p<0.0001).\r\nConclusions \r\nThe results of this study suggest that the addition of a pedometer to a short-term education program does not produce added benefits with respect to increasing physical activity in the Lower Mississippi Delta.\r\nTrial Registration \r\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01264757","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Katzmarzyk Peter T; Champagne Catherine M; Tudor-Locke Catrine ; Broyles Stephanie T; Harsha David ; Kennedy Betty M; Johnson William D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0026667","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Katzmarzyk Peter T, Champagne Catherine M, Tudor-Locke Catrine, Broyles Stephanie T, Harsha David, Kennedy Betty M, and Johnson William D (2011) A Short-Term Physical Activity Randomized Trial in the Lower Mississippi Delta.

  Objective  In dyadic planning a target person and a planning partner create plans for when, where, and how the target person will change a health-relevant behavior. Across 52 weeks, direct and indirect effects of a dyadic-planning intervention on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and physical fitness in target persons and their partners were investigated in a randomized controlled trial. Relationship quality was explored as a moderator.    Methods  N = 338 couples (target persons randomized) were randomly assigned to a dyadic-planning- (DPC), an individual-planning- (IPC), or a no-planning dyadic-control condition (CC). MVPA was objectively assessed four times across 52 weeks using accelerometry. Physical fitness and proposed mediators (individual action control, received behavior-specific support and control) were repeatedly assessed. Relationship quality was measured at baseline. Latent growth curve-, multi-level-, and manifest mediation models were fit.    Results  Across 52 weeks, MVPA of IPC and CC target persons increased. MVPA of DPC target persons remained stable, but those who reported high relationship quality increased their MVPA over time. DPC partners showed steeper increases in physical fitness when compared to IPC partners, but not CC partners. DPC partners’ increases in physical fitness were mediated by received support from target persons.    Conclusions  The dyadic planning intervention showed non-beneficial effects for target persons’ MVPA, but beneficial effects on their partners’ fitness. These findings resemble evidence from the social support literature indicating more benefits for support providers than for recipients.

Yet few systematic efforts to evaluate the efficacy of hand-held computers and similar devices for enhancing physical activity levels have occurred. The purpose of this first-generation study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hand-held computer (i.e., personal digital assistant [PDA]) for increasing moderate intensity or more vigorous (MOD+) physical activity levels over 8 weeks in mid-life and older adults relative to a standard information control arm.  Design  Randomized, controlled 8-week experiment. Data were collected in 2005 and analyzed in 2006–2007.  Setting/Participants  Community-based study of 37 healthy, initially underactive adults aged 50 years and older who were randomized and completed the 8-week study (intervention=19, control=18).  Intervention  Participants received an instructional session and a PDA programmed to monitor their physical activity levels twice per day and provide daily and weekly individualized feedback, goal setting, and support. Controls received standard, age-appropriate written physical activity educational materials.  Main Outcome Measure  Physical activity was assessed via the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire at baseline and 8 weeks.  Results  Relative to controls, intervention participants reported significantly greater 8-week mean estimated caloric expenditure levels and minutes per week in MOD+ activity ( p   Conclusions  Results from this first-generation study indicate that hand-held computers may be effective tools for increasing initial physical activity levels among underactive adults.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"King Abby C; Ahn David K; Oliveira Brian M; Atienza Audie A; Castro Cynthia M; Gardner Christopher D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.AMEPRE.2007.09.025","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"King Abby C, Ahn David K, Oliveira Brian M, Atienza Audie A, Castro Cynthia M, and Gardner Christopher D (2008) Promoting physical activity through hand-held computer technology..

The intervention was delivered when children were in school year 5 (age 9-10 years). Schools allocated to control received standard teaching.\r\n\r\nMain outcome measures The pre-specified primary outcomes were accelerometer assessed minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day, accelerometer assessed minutes of sedentary behaviour per day, and reported daily consumption of servings of fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nResults 60 schools with more than 2221 children were recruited; valid data were available for fruit and vegetable consumption for 2121 children, for accelerometer assessed physical activity and sedentary behaviour for 1252 children, and for secondary outcomes for between 1825 and 2212 children for the main analyses. None of the three primary outcomes differed between children in schools allocated to the AFLY5 intervention and those allocated to the control group. The difference in means comparing the intervention group with the control group was –1.35 (95% confidence interval –5.29 to 2.59) minutes per day for moderate to vigorous physical activity, –0.11 (–9.71 to 9.49) minutes per day for sedentary behaviour, and 0.08 (–0.12 to 0.28) servings per day for fruit and vegetable consumption. The intervention was effective for three out of nine of the secondary outcomes after multiple testing was taken into account: self reported time spent in screen viewing at the weekend (–21 (–37 to –4) minutes per day), self reported servings of snacks per day (–0.22 (–0.38 to –0.05)), and servings of high energy drinks per day (–0.26 (–0.43 to –0.10)) were all reduced. Results from a series of sensitivity analyses testing different assumptions about missing data and from per protocol analyses produced similar results.\r\n\r\nConclusion The findings suggest that the AFLY5 school based intervention is not effective at increasing levels of physical activity, decreasing sedentary behaviour, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in primary school children. Change in these activities may require more intensive behavioural interventions with children or upstream interventions at the family and societal level, as well as at the school environment level. These findings have relevance for researchers, policy makers, public health practitioners, and doctors who are involved in health promotion, policy making, and commissioning services.\r\n\r\nTrial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN50133740.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kipping Ruth R; Howe Laura D; Jago Russell ; Campbell Rona ; Wells Sian ; Chittleborough Catherine R; Mytton Julie ; Noble Sian M; Peters Tim J; Lawlor Debbie A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1136/BMJ.G3256","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kipping Ruth R, Howe Laura D, Jago Russell, Campbell Rona, Wells Sian, Chittleborough Catherine R, Mytton Julie, Noble Sian M, Peters Tim J, and Lawlor Debbie A (2014) Effect of intervention aimed at increasing physical activity, reducing sedentary behaviour, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children: Active for Life Year 5 (AFLY5) school based cluster randomised controlled trial.

activity is an important component of Type 2 diabetes care but underutilized. Physical activity consultations are successful at increasing physical activity in people with diabetes but resources are often limited. Limited research has reported on the effect of physical activity intervention on the quality of life of people with Type 2 diabetes. The TIME2ACT study investigated the 12 month effectiveness of physical activity consultation for people with Type 2 diabetes delivered in person or in written form, compared to controls. 134 people in a contemplation or preparation stage were randomised to receive one of the above interventions. Objective and subjective physical activity was measured over 1 week along with quality of life (SF12v2, PANAS, Wellbeing questionnaire and Vitality scale) and self efficacy for exercise at baseline, and 6 and 12 months post intervention. There was no interaction (time & group) effect in accelerometer counts (P=0.863), step counts (p=0.739), time in moderate intensity or above (P=0.841) and the seven-day recall (p=0.212) over 6 and 12 months. In this group the only intervention effect was for self-efficacy (P=0.01), with an increase (P=0.059) from baseline to 6 months (person-delivered group) and a decrease from baseline to 6 months (P=0.047) (controls). In subgroup analysis of participants (n=36) with baseline pedometer steps <5000/day, the physical activity consultation delivered in person group increased physical activity over 12 months and the controls decreased. In this subgroup changes in quality of life were; a decrease (P=0.002) from baseline to 12 months in controls in the SF12 physical component score and a decrease from baseline to 12 months and 6 to 12 months (P<0.05) in the physical activity consultation delivered in person group in the SF12 mental component score (both changes indicating a better health score). More research is needed investigating methods to promote physical activity in diabetes care. Studies should include quality of life outcomes due to current lack of published data and importance of outcomes to patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kirk Alison ; Barnett Jodi ; Leese Graham ; Mutrie Nanette ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kirk Alison, Barnett Jodi, Leese Graham, and Mutrie Nanette (2009) Twelve month changes in physical activity and quality of life outcomes following a physical activity consultation delivered in person or in written form in Type 2 diabetes : the TIME2ACT study.

 Physical activity (PA) declines throughout adolescence, therefore PA promotion during this period is important. We analyzed the effect of two school-based PA interventions on daily PA levels, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscle strength among adolescents.  Methods  For the nine-month School in Motion intervention study (ScIM), we cluster-randomized 30 Norwegian secondary schools (N = 2084, mean age [SD] = 14 [0.3] years) to one of three study arms. The physically active learning (PAL) intervention included 30 min physically active learning, 30 min PA and a 60 min physical education (PE) lesson per week. The Don't worry-Be happy (DWBH) intervention included a 60 min PA lesson and a 60 min PE lesson per week, both tailored to promote friendships and wellbeing. Both intervention arms were designed to engage the adolescents in 120 min of PA per week in addition to recess and mandatory PE lessons. The control group continued as per usual, including the standard amount of mandatory PE. PA (main outcome) was assessed by accelerometers, CRF and muscle strength (secondary outcomes) were assessed by an intermittent running test and selected tests from the Eurofit test battery.  Results  Daily PA and time spent in moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) decreased in all groups throughout the intervention. The mean difference in PA level and MVPA for participants in the PAL-intervention arm was 34.7 cpm (95% CI: 4.1, 65.3) and 4.7 min/day (95% CI: 0.6, 8.8) higher, respectively, compared to the control arm. There were no significant intervention effects on daily PA level, MVPA or time spent sedentary for adolescents in the DWBH-intervention arm. Adolescents in the PAL-intervention arm increased distance covered in the running test compared to controls (19.8 m, 95% CI: 10.4, 29.1), whilst a negative intervention effect was observed among adolescents in the DWBH-intervention arm (- 11.6 m, 95% CI: - 22.0, - 1.1).  Conclusion  The PAL-intervention resulted in a significantly smaller decrease in daily PA level, time spent in MVPA, and increased CRF compared to controls. Our results indicate that a teacher-led intervention, including three unique intervention components, is effective in curbing the decline in PA observed across our cohort and improving CRF.

Despite the potential benefits, many men living withprostate cancer do not participate in regular exercise.Aim: To test the efficacy of a clinician referral and exercise program toimprove physical activity levels, psychological wellbeing and quality of lifeamong men with prostate cancer.Methods: A multicentre, cluster randomized controlled trial in Melbourne,Australia, randomized 15 clinicians to either refer eligible participants(n = 54) to a supervised exercise program (two gym sessions and one home-based session per week for 12 weeks) or follow usual care (n = 93). Theprimary outcome was self-reported physical activity. Secondary outcomes:an objective measure of physical activity, quality of life, levels of anxiety andsymptoms of depression.Results: At 12 weeks, no significant intervention effects were observed forcombined moderate and vigorous physical activity levels (effect size: 0.08;95% CI: -0.28, 0.45; p = 0.48); significant intervention effects were observedfor vigorous-intensity exercise (effect size: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.82;p = 0.010). Significant intervention effects were observed for the percentageof participants meeting exercise guidelines (≥150 minutes per week) basedon combined moderate-vigorous (Odds Ratio (OR): 3.9; 95% CI: 1.9, 7.8;p = 0.002) exercise; a significant inverse effect was observed on anxietylevels (effect size: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.79; p = 0.02) and borderline inter-vention effects for depression symptoms (effect size: -0.35, 95% CI: -0.71,0.02; p = 0.06); 80% of participants reported the clinician’s recommenda-tion influenced them to participate in the 12-week exercise program.Conclusions: Clinicians are ideally suited to refer men to tailored exerciseprograms as part of their clinical care for men who have completed activetreatment for prostate cancer, to improve physical activity levels and qualityof life outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Livingston Patricia M; Craike Melinda ; Salmon Jo ; Courneya Kerry ; Gaskin Cadeyrn J; Fraser Steve F; Mohebbi Mohammadreza ; Broadbent Suzanne ; Botti Mari ; Kent Bridie ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Livingston Patricia M, Craike Melinda, Salmon Jo, Courneya Kerry, Gaskin Cadeyrn J, Fraser Steve F, Mohebbi Mohammadreza, Broadbent Suzanne, Botti Mari, and Kent Bridie (2014) Effects of a clinical referral and exercise program for men who have completed active treatment for prostate cancer: a multicentre cluster randomized controlled trial (ENGAGE).

randomized trial compared physical activity enhancing exercise prescription and education programs in 61 children (36 male) with single-ventricle physiology after Fontan. After Fontan, children are less active than recommended for optimal health. They are often geographically dispersed and unable to attend weekday programs. Participants, 5.9–11.7 years of age who were status 5.3 years post-Fontan, received 12-month, parent-delivered home programs to enhance physical activity, motor skill, fitness, and activity attitudes. Daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was measured at baseline and again at 6, 12, and 24 months. Secondary outcomes were gross motor skill, fitness, and activity attitudes. Gross motor skill (p = .01) was significantly greater at the end of the 2-year study period for both intervention groups combined. MVPA at 2 years was significantly greater (p = .03) than the predicted decrease with age. Spring season (85 ± 25 min), male sex (69 ± 21 min), greater baseline activity (0.3 ± 0.1 min/baseline minute), and better gross motor skill (1.1 ± 0.4 min/percentile) increased weekly MVPA in a multivariable repeated-measures regression model adjusted for intervention, maturation during the 2-year study, sex, season, and baseline activity. Benefits were not influenced by type of rehabilitation, compliance, or rural/urban location. Home-based, pediatric physical activity rehabilitation enhances physical activity, gross motor skill, exercise capacity, and physical fitness among preadolescent children after Fontan regardless of rural/urban location. Prescribed education and exercise programs are similarly effective for providing the important health benefits of daily physical activity. Enhanced gross motor skill is associated with increased MVPA despite exercise capacity limitations after Fontan. Rehabilitation attenuates the expected decrease in MVPA with age.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Longmuir Patricia E; Longmuir Patricia E; Tyrrell Pascal N; Corey Mary ; Faulkner Guy ; Russell Jennifer L; McCrindle Brian W; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/S00246-012-0618-8","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Longmuir Patricia E, Longmuir Patricia E, Tyrrell Pascal N, Corey Mary, Faulkner Guy, Russell Jennifer L, and McCrindle Brian W (2013) Home-Based Rehabilitation Enhances Daily Physical Activity and Motor Skill in Children Who Have Undergone the Fontan Procedure.

The ACTIVATE Trial examined the efficacy of an intervention (use of the Garmin Vivofit 2 activity monitor coupled with a behavioral feedback and goal-setting session and 5 telephone-delivered health coaching sessions) to increase moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and reduce sedentary behavior in breast cancer survivors.  Methods  This randomized controlled trial recruited 83 inactive, postmenopausal women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer who had completed primary treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group or to the control group, and the intervention was delivered over a 12-week period. MVPA and sedentary behavior were measured with Actigraph and activPAL accelerometers at baseline (T1) and at the end of the intervention (T2).  Results  Retention in the trial was high, with 80 (96%) of participants completing T2 data collection. At T2, there was a significant between-group difference in MVPA (69 min/wk; 95% CI = 22-116) favoring the intervention group. The trial resulted in a statistically significant decrease in both total sitting time and prolonged bouts (≥20 min) of sitting, with between-group reductions of 37 min/d (95% CI = -72 to -2) and 42 min/d (95% CI = -83 to -2), respectively, favoring the intervention group.  Conclusion  Results from the ACTIVATE Trial suggest that the use of wearable technology presents an inexpensive and scalable opportunity to facilitate more active lifestyles for cancer survivors. Whether or not such wearable technology-based interventions can create sustainable behavioral change should be the subject of future research.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lynch Brigid M; Lynch Brigid M; Nguyen Nga H; Moore Melissa M; Reeves Marina M; Rosenberg Dori E; Boyle Terry ; Vallance Jeff K; Milton Shakira ; Friedenreich Christine M; Friedenreich Christine M; English Dallas R; English Dallas R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/CNCR.32143","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lynch Brigid M, Lynch Brigid M, Nguyen Nga H, Moore Melissa M, Reeves Marina M, Rosenberg Dori E, Boyle Terry, Vallance Jeff K, Milton Shakira, Friedenreich Christine M, Friedenreich Christine M, English Dallas R, and English Dallas R (2019) A randomized controlled trial of a wearable technology-based intervention for increasing moderate to vigorous physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior in breast cancer survivors: The ACTIVATE Trial.

concealed allocation with blinded assessments at baseline, 10, and 20 weeks. Forty-one adolescents with CP participated (26 males, 15 females; mean age 13y 7mo, SD 1y 8mo, range 11–17y; Gross Motor Function Classification System levels: I, n=21; II, n=17; III, n=3; unilateral distribution n=16, bilateral n=25). Primary outcome was physical activity (NL-1000 accelerometers and self-report [Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adolescents: MARCA]). Secondary outcomes were exercise knowledge (a purpose-designed scale), attitudes, intention and self-efficacy (Lifestyle Education for Activity Program II scales), self-reported sedentary behaviour (MARCA), and functional capacity (6-min walk test).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults  At 10 weeks the intervention group showed no increased physical activity compared with the comparison group (weekly steps: change of +2420 vs −12189 steps p=0.06; weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity: change of +70 vs +8min, p=0.06; weekly distance walked: change of +3 vs −9.1km, p=0.05) and exercise knowledge (12% vs 1% improvement, p=0.08). There were no statistically significant differences for these outcomes at 20 weeks, or in self-reported physical activity at 10 or 20 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterpretation  There was a positive short-term pattern for improvement in physical activity and knowledge. Internet-based programs may offer an alternative for participants unable to attend regular face-to-face physical activity programs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Maher Carol A; Williams Marie T; Olds Tim ; Lane Alison E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/J.1469-8749.2009.03609.X","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Maher Carol A, Williams Marie T, Olds Tim, and Lane Alison E (2010) An internet‐based physical activity intervention for adolescents with cerebral palsy: a randomized controlled trial.

activity reduces cancer risk, yet African American adults remain insufficiently active, contributing to cancer health disparities. Harmony & Health (HH) was developed as a culturally adapted mind-body intervention to promote physical activity, psychosocial well-being, and quality of life among a church-based sample of overweight/obese, insufficiently active African American adults. Men and women were recruited to the study through an existing church partnership. Eligible participants (N = 50) were randomized to a movement-based mind-body intervention (n = 26) or waitlist control (n = 24). Participants in the intervention attended 16 mind-body sessions over 8 weeks and completed a physical assessment, questionnaires on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and psychosocial factors, and accelerometry at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 6 week follow-up (T3). Eighty percent of participants (94% women, M age = 49.7 ± 9.4 years, M body mass index = 32.8 ± 5.2 kg/m2) completed the study, and 61.5% of intervention participants attended ≥10 mind-body sessions. Participants self-reported doing 78.8 ± 102.9 (median = 40.7, range: 0-470.7) min/day of MVPA and did 27.1 ± 20.7 (median = 22.0, range: 0-100.5) min/day of accelerometer-measured MVPA at baseline. Trends suggest that mind-body participants self-reported greater improvements in physical activity and psychosocial well-being from baseline to post-intervention than waitlist control participants. HH is feasible and acceptable among African American adults. Trends suggest that the mind-body intervention led to improvements in physical activity and psychosocial outcomes. This study extends the literature on the use of mind-body practices to promote physical and psychological health and reduce cancer disparities in African American adults.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mama Scherezade K; Bhuiyan Nishat ; Chaoul Alejandro ; Cohen Lorenzo ; Fagundes Christopher P; Hoover Diana S; Strong Larkin L; Li Yisheng ; Nguyen Nga T; McNeill Lorna H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/TBM/IBY114","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mama Scherezade K, Bhuiyan Nishat, Chaoul Alejandro, Cohen Lorenzo, Fagundes Christopher P, Hoover Diana S, Strong Larkin L, Li Yisheng, Nguyen Nga T, and McNeill Lorna H (2020) Feasibility and acceptability of a faith-based mind-body intervention among African American adults..

The maintenance effect of the interventions on study outcomes was also assessed.  Methods  The Breast Cancer and Physical Activity Level pilot trial randomized 45 breast cancer survivors to a home-based, 12-wk lower (300 min·wk at 40%-59% of HR reserve) or higher-intensity PA (150 min·wk at 60%-80% of HR reserve), or no PA intervention/control. Both intervention groups received Polar A360® activity trackers. Study outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 and 24 wk included PA and sedentary time (ActiGraph GT3X+), health-related fitness (e.g., body composition, cardiopulmonary fitness/V˙O2max), and patient-reported outcomes (e.g., quality of life). Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted using linear mixed models and adjusted for baseline outcomes.  Results  Increases in moderate-vigorous intensity PA (least squares adjusted group difference [LSAGD], 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1-1.0) and decreases in sedentary time (LSAGD, -1.2; 95% CI, -2.2 to -0.2) were significantly greater in the lower-intensity PA group versus control at 12 wk. Increases in V˙O2max at 12 wk in both interventions groups were significantly greater than changes in the control group (lower-intensity PA group LSAGD, 4.2; 95% CI, 0.5-8.0 mL·kg·min; higher-intensity PA group LSAGD, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.7-9.1 mL·kg·min). Changes in PA and V˙O2max remained at 24 wk, but differences between the intervention and control groups were no longer statistically significant.  Conclusions  Increases in PA time and cardiopulmonary fitness/V˙O2max can be achieved with both lower- and higher-intensity PA interventions in breast cancer survivors. Reductions in sedentary time were also noted in the lower-intensity PA group.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McNeil Jessica ; Brenner Darren R; Brenner Darren R; Stone Chelsea R; O'Reilly Rachel ; Ruan Yibing ; Vallance Jeff K; Courneya Kerry S; Thorpe Kevin E; Thorpe Kevin E; Klein Doug J; Friedenreich Christine M; Friedenreich Christine M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1249/MSS.0000000000001890","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McNeil Jessica, Brenner Darren R, Brenner Darren R, Stone Chelsea R, O'Reilly Rachel, Ruan Yibing, Vallance Jeff K, Courneya Kerry S, Thorpe Kevin E, Thorpe Kevin E, Klein Doug J, Friedenreich Christine M, and Friedenreich Christine M (2019) Activity Tracker to Prescribe Various Exercise Intensities in Breast Cancer Survivors..

The objective was to conduct an RCT of a bicycle train program to assess impact on students’ school travel mode and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).    Study design  Pilot cluster RCT with randomization at the school level and N=54 participants.    Setting/participants  Fourth–fifth graders from four public schools serving low-income families in Seattle, WA in 2014 with analyses in 2015–2016. All participants were provided and fitted with bicycles, safety equipment (helmets, locks, and lights), and a 2- to 3-hour bicycle safety course.    Intervention  The intervention was a bicycle train offered daily (i.e., students volunteered to cycle with study staff to and from school).    Main outcome measures  Time 1 assessments occurred prior to randomization. Time 2 assessments occurred after 3–5 weeks of the intervention (i.e., during Weeks 4–6 of the intervention period). The primary outcome was the percentage of daily commutes to school by cycling measured by validated survey. MVPA, measured by accelerometry and GPS units and processed by machine learning algorithms, was a secondary outcome.    Results  For two separate adjusted repeated measures linear mixed effects models in which students (N=54) were nested within schools (N=4), intervention participants had: (1) an absolute increase in mean percentage of daily commutes by cycling of 44.9%, (95% CI=26.8, 63.0) and (2) an increase in mean MVPA of 21.6 minutes/day, (95% CI=8.7, 34.6) from Time 1 to Time 2 compared with controls.    Conclusions  A pilot bicycle train intervention increased cycling to school and daily MVPA in the short term among diverse, inner-city elementary school students. The bicycle train intervention appears promising and warrants further experimental trials among large, diverse samples with longer follow-up.    Trial registration  This study is registered at  www.clinicaltrials.gov  NCT02006186.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mendoza Jason A; Mendoza Jason A; Mendoza Jason A; Haaland Wren ; Jacobs Maya ; Abbey-Lambertz Mark ; Miller Josh ; Salls Deb ; Todd Winifred ; Madding Rachel ; Ellis Katherine ; Kerr Jacqueline ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.AMEPRE.2017.05.001","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mendoza Jason A, Mendoza Jason A, Mendoza Jason A, Haaland Wren, Jacobs Maya, Abbey-Lambertz Mark, Miller Josh, Salls Deb, Todd Winifred, Madding Rachel, Ellis Katherine, and Kerr Jacqueline (2017) Bicycle Trains, Cycling, and Physical Activity: A Pilot Cluster RCT..

  Regular physical activity (PA) is of central importance for healthy ageing. However, in Germany, only 42% of older adults currently reach the PA recommendations of the World Health Organization. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of two web-based interventions on PA in adults aged 65–75 years living in Northwestern Germany compared to a delayed intervention control group (CG). 589 older adults were randomized to one of the three groups. Participants in intervention group 1 (IG1) received access to a web-based intervention for ten weeks assisting them in self-tracking PA behavior. Participants in IG2 received the intervention of IG1 and additionally an activity tracker to objectively track PA behavior. To analyze differences in objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous PA and sedentary time between baseline and follow-up (12 weeks after baseline), linear mixed models were used. The interaction effects revealed a decrease in minutes spent on moderate-to-vigorous PA in bouts of 10 min by 11 min per week in IG1 participants (β = −11.08, 95% CI: (−35.03; 12.87)). In comparison, IG2 participants were 7 min more physically active at follow-up (β = 7.48, 95% CI: (−17.64; 32.60)). Sedentary time in bouts of 30 min per week increased in IG1 participants (β = 106.77, 95% CI: (−47.69; 261.23)) and decreased in IG2 participants at follow-up (β = −16.45, 95% CI: (−178.83; 145.94)). Participation in the two web-based interventions did not lead to significant increases in moderate-to-vigorous PA or significant decreases in sedentary time compared to the CG.  The study was registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00010052, 07-11-2016).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Muellmann Saskia ; Buck Christoph ; Voelcker-Rehage Claudia ; Bragina Inna ; Lippke Sonia ; Meyer Jochen ; Peters Manuela ; Peters Manuela ; Pischke Claudia R; Pischke Claudia R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.PMEDR.2019.100958","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Muellmann Saskia, Buck Christoph, Voelcker-Rehage Claudia, Bragina Inna, Lippke Sonia, Meyer Jochen, Peters Manuela, Peters Manuela, Pischke Claudia R, and Pischke Claudia R (2019) Effects of two web-based interventions promoting physical activity among older adults compared to a delayed intervention control group in Northwestern Germany: Results of the PROMOTE community-based intervention trial..

promoting population health through physical activity (PA) and exposure to nature are popular, but few have been evaluated in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). To investigate the effectiveness of a park prescription intervention (PPI) for improving total moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), other PA related behaviors, quality of life (QoL) and cardio-metabolic health among adults. Healthy individuals aged 40 to 65 years were recruited through community health screenings and randomly assigned to 1) PPI: face-to-face Park Prescription + invitation to weekly exercise sessions in parks, or 2) control: standard PA materials. After the six-month intervention, participants completed accelerometer assessments, questionnaires on health behaviors and QoL, and health screenings. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare outcomes between groups, with secondary analysis adjusted for co-variates via multiple linear regression. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Eighty participants were allocated to each group. Participants with mean age of 51.1 (Standard Deviation: 6.3) years were predominantly female (79%) and of Chinese ethnicity (81%). Participation in the group exercise started at 48% and declined to 24% by week 26. At six-months, 145 (91%) participants attended health screenings for outcome measure collection, and 126 (79%) provided valid accelerometer data. Time spent in MVPA favored the PPI group but this difference was not statistically significant (4.4 (− 43.8, 52.7) minutes/week; when removing 2 extreme outliers 26.8 (− 9.7, 63.4) minutes/week). Time spent in parks (147.5 (2.1, 292.9) minutes/month), PA in parks (192.5 (59.5, 325.5) minutes/month), and recreational PA (48.7 (1.4, 96.0) minutes/week) were significantly greater in the PPI group. PPI also significantly improved psychological QoL (4.0 (0.0, 8.0). PPI improved park use, PA in parks, recreational PA, and psychological QoL but not total MVPA. Future RCTs’ are warranted to investigate PPI in different target populations and to provide further evidence for improvements in health outcomes.

The purpose of the Synergy Study is to test the efficacy of a mobile health combined behavior intervention targeting physical activity and sleep quality.    Study design  Randomized, waitlist-controlled trial.    Setting/participants  This study had an app-based delivery mode, Australia-wide. The participants were 160 adults who reported insufficient physical activity and poor sleep quality in an eligibility survey.    Intervention  The intervention was a mobile app providing educational resources, goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback strategies. It included 12 weeks of personalized support including weekly reports, tool sheets, and prompts.    Main outcome measures  Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months (primary), and 6 months (secondary endpoint). Self-reported minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and sleep quality were co-primary outcomes. Resistance training; sitting time; sleep hygiene; sleep timing variability; insomnia severity; daytime sleepiness; quality of life; and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were secondary outcomes. Data were collected between June 2017 and February 2018 and analyzed in August 2018.    Results  At 3 months, between-group differences in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity were not statistically significant (p=0.139). Significantly more participants in the intervention group engaged in ≥2 days/week (p=0.004) of resistance training. The intervention group reported better overall sleep quality (p=0.009), subjective sleep quality (p=0.017), sleep onset latency (p=0.013), waketime variability (p=0.018), sleep hygiene (p=0.027), insomnia severity (p=0.002), and lower stress symptoms (p=0.032) relative to waitlist controls. At 6 months, group differences were maintained for sleep hygiene (p=0.048), insomnia severity (p=0.002), and stress symptoms (p=0.006). Differences were observed for bedtime variability (p=0.023), sleepiness (p    Conclusions  This remotely delivered intervention did not produce statistically significant between-group differences in minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. Significant short-term differences in resistance training and short- and medium-term differences in sleep health in favor of the intervention were observed.

Methods The study was conducted at the Miriam Hospital/Brown Medical School in Providence, RI, and in communities of Southeastern Massachusetts from 2002 to 2005. Previously sedentary women (n=280; mean age=47.1; 94.6% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) Choose to Move, a self-help printed booklet (n=93), (2) Jumpstart, a motivationally tailored, print based intervention (n=95); or (3) Wellness, women's health materials (n=92). Face-to-face contact at months 3 (M3) and 12 (M12) occurred within participants' communities in local libraries. Results At M3, participants in the Jumpstart condition reported significantly more minutes of physical activity per week (M=140.4, SE=14.82) than participants in the Wellness condition (M=98.1, SE=15.09), (t(275)=2.00, p<0.05). The Jumpstart arm showed a trend towards significance (t(275)=1.93, p=0.054) when compared with the CTM arm (M=99.5, SE=15.11); there was no significant difference between the CTM and Wellness arms (t(275)=0.07, p=NS). At M12, there were no significant differences (F(2,275)=0.147, p=NS) between any of the treatment arms. Conclusions Results suggest that print-based programs for physical activity may be efficacious short-term, but more research is needed to find approaches that are effective long-term. It is possible to deliver print-based programs through existing community infrastructures, however these approaches need further evaluation to examine maintenance effects apart from the demand characteristics of a research study.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Napolitano Melissa A; Whiteley Jessica A; Papandonatos George ; Dutton Gareth ; Farrell Nancy C; Albrecht Anna ; Bock Beth ; Bazzarre Terry ; Sciamanna Christopher ; Dunn Andrea L; Marcus Bess H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2006.06.011","Keywords":"Exercise\r\nIntervention studies\r\nExpert systems\r\nCommunity intervention\r\nWomen's health\r\nTranslation research","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Napolitano Melissa A, Whiteley Jessica A, Papandonatos George, Dutton Gareth, Farrell Nancy C, Albrecht Anna, Bock Beth, Bazzarre Terry, Sciamanna Christopher, Dunn Andrea L, and Marcus Bess H (2006) Outcomes from the women's wellness project: A community-focused physical activity trial for women.

β-cell function is present at the time of diagnosis with Type 1 diabetes. Preserving this β-cell function reduces complications. We hypothesized that exercise preserves β-cell function in Type 1 diabetes and undertook a pilot trial to address the key uncertainties in designing a definitive trial to test this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nA randomized controlled pilot trial in adults aged 16–60 years diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes within the previous 3 months was undertaken. Participants were assigned to control (usual care) or intervention (exercise consultation every month), in a 1 : 1 ratio for 12 months. The primary outcomes were recruitment rate, drop out, exercise adherence [weeks with ≥ 150 min of self-reported moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)], and exercise uptake in the control group. The secondary outcomes were differences in insulin sensitivity and rate of loss of β-cell function between intervention and control at 6 and 12 months.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nOf 507 individuals who were approached, 58 (28 control, 30 intervention) entered the study and 41 completed it. Participants were largely white European males, BMI 24.8 ± 3.8 kg/m2, HbA1c 75 ± 25 mmol/mol (9 ± 2%). Mean level of objectively measured MVPA increased in the intervention group (mean 243 to 273 min/week) and 61% of intervention participants reached the target of ≥ 150 min/week of self-reported MVPA on at least 42 weeks of the year. Physical activity levels fell slightly in the control group (mean 277 to 235 min of MVPA/week). There was exploratory evidence that intervention group became more insulin sensitive and required less insulin. However, the rate of loss of β-cell function appeared similar between the groups, although the change in insulin sensitivity may have affected this.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWe show that it is possible to recruit and randomize people with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes to a trial of an exercise intervention, and increase and maintain their exercise levels for 12 months. Future trials need to incorporate measures of greater adherence to exercise training targets, and include more appropriate measures of β-cell function.

We investigated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of advice-based interventions aiming at either increasing moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) or reducing sedentary time (ST) in obese volunteers.    Design  Randomized non-blinded two-armed trial.    Method  Inactive, obese adults were randomly assigned to reduce sedentary behavior (SitLess) (n = 30) or increase MVPA (ExMore) (n = 29) for 4 weeks. Participants wore ActivPAL (AP) and ActiGraph (AG) devices for 7 consecutive days at baseline and during the final week of the intervention period. Cardiometabolic risk factors (waist circumference, BMI, percent body fat, blood pressure, VO 2 max and blood markers) were measured at baseline and at follow-up. Trial was set in Midtjylland Denmark from 2012 to 2014.    Results  The interventions were completed by 77% (SitLess) and 69% (ExMore) of the participants. The SitLess group reduced sedentary time by 53 min/day (95% CI 10; 96; P  2 max by 8% and 11%, respectively (P     Conclusions  This trial showed that completion of 4-week, advice-based interventions led to reduced ST or increased MVPA in obese adults. Furthermore, both interventions led to small significant increases in VO 2 max. Studies of longer duration are needed to determine if these behavioral changes can be maintained, and to quantify possible longterm effects of reduced ST or increased MVPA on cardiometabolic risk factors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Overgaard Kristian ; Nannerup Kirstine ; Lunen Mette Kirstine Birk; Maindal Helle Terkildsen; Larsen Ryan G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.JSAMS.2017.10.037","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Overgaard Kristian, Nannerup Kirstine, Lunen Mette Kirstine Birk, Maindal Helle Terkildsen, and Larsen Ryan G (2017) Exercise more or sit less?

To determine the effects of individually tailored interventions designed to increase physical activity (PA) in cardiac patients. METHODS A total of 99 (77 men and 22 women, 61.5 ± 10.7 yr) patients entering a phase III cardiac rehabilitation program completed a 12-wk PA intervention. Patients were randomized to usual care (UC, time-based recommendation), pedometer feedback (PF), newsletter-based motivational messaging (MM), or PF + MM. Both PF groups were given a goal of increasing steps/d by 10% of individual baseline value each week. If the goal for the week was not reached, the same goal was used for the next week. Physical activity was assessed for 7 d before beginning and after completing the program. The change in steps/d, moderate to vigorous intensity PA minutes, and sedentary time were compared among intervention groups. RESULTS Average change in steps/d was found to be significantly greater (P < .01) in the PF (2957 ± 3185) and the PF + MM (3150 ± 3007) compared with UC (264 ± 2065) and MM (718 ± 2415) groups. No group experienced changes in moderate to vigorous intensity PA time and only the PF intervention group decreased sedentary time (baseline 470.2 ± 77.1 to postintervention 447.8 ± 74.9 min/d, P = .01). CONCLUSION The findings from this study demonstrate that using PF was superior to the usual time-based PA recommendations and to newsletter-based MM in patients starting a phase III CR program. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are encouraged to implement PA feedback with individualized PA goals in order to support the increase in PA.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ozemek Cemal ; Strath Scott J; Riggin Katrina ; Harber Matthew P; Imboden Mary T; Kaminsky Leonard A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/HCR.0000000000000472","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ozemek Cemal, Strath Scott J, Riggin Katrina, Harber Matthew P, Imboden Mary T, and Kaminsky Leonard A (2020) Pedometer Feedback Interventions Increase Daily Physical Activity in Phase III Cardiac Rehabilitation Participants..

Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with reduced physical function and quality of life (QoL). We investigated the impact of a structured lifestyle intervention on the promotion of physical activity (PA) and reduction of sedentary behavior (SB), and its effect on QoL in men on ADT. Methods: Patients with advanced PCa on long-term ADT were randomized to the intervention (N = 11) or a control arm (N = 10) between February 2018 and May 2019. The intervention group received a structured lifestyle intervention including motivational text messages for 8 weeks (maintenance visit at week 12). At each visit, self-report measures and accelerometer data were used to assess PA and SB, and questionnaires were used to measure QoL, life satisfaction, anxiety, and depression. Results: Significantly greater improvements in QoL and depression compared to baseline were reported in the intervention group compared to the control group. In addition, the intervention group also showed a significantly greater increase in self-reported light, as well as moderate-to-vigorous PA, and reduction in self-reported SB. Conclusions: Given its inherent advantage in improving QoL and reducing depression, a lifestyle intervention program should be offered to patients on ADT.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Park Saengryeol ; Kim Kwangnam ; Ahn Hyun Kyu; Kim Jong Won; Min Gyurang ; Chung Byung Ha; Koo Kyo Chul; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5993/AJHB.44.1.10","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Park Saengryeol, Kim Kwangnam, Ahn Hyun Kyu, Kim Jong Won, Min Gyurang, Chung Byung Ha, and Koo Kyo Chul (2020) Impact of Lifestyle Intervention for Patients with Prostate Cancer..

The potential effect of adding physical activity counselling on depressive symptoms and physical activity was also explored. Participants were randomly assigned to a 12-week programme comprising an orientation and access to fitness centre resources (control, n = 18) or that programme plus 6 physical activity counselling sessions (intervention, n = 18). Outcome measures were feasibility (fitness centre attendance over 12 weeks); Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) completed at baseline and week 12; and qualitative programme feedback. Fitness centre attendance averaged only 12 days (14% of all possible days) with no differences between study groups. No group differences were found on IPAQ or BDI-II scores at week 12. Increases from baseline in IPAQ moderate/vigorous activity minutes were associated with decreases in BDI-II scores at week 12 (p < 0.001). The most helpful programme aspect reported was connecting participants to fitness centre resources. In this pilot study of depressed outpatients, an unsupervised fitness centre based program was not feasible for promoting exercise adherence and adding physical activity counselling was not useful for increasing physical activity levels or reducing depression.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Patten Christi Ann; Vickers Kristin S; Lewis Beth A; Finnie Steven B; Wheeldon Theresa J; Decker Paul A; Stevens Susanna ; Hathaway Julie C; Reese Michael M; Seime Richard J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/13548506.2018.1499944","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Patten Christi Ann, Vickers Kristin S, Lewis Beth A, Finnie Steven B, Wheeldon Theresa J, Decker Paul A, Stevens Susanna, Hathaway Julie C, Reese Michael M, and Seime Richard J (2019) Feasibility trial of an unsupervised, facility-based exercise programme for depressed outpatients.

Thus, the purpose of the current study was to culturally and linguistically adapt an empirically supported, individually tailored physical activity print intervention for Latinos and then conduct an RCT of the modified program.  Design  An RCT was conducted.  Setting/participants  The sample included 93 overweight/obese (80%) Latinas with low income and acculturation.  Intervention  Data were collected in 2007–2008 and analyzed by intent-to-treat in 2009. Participants were randomly assigned to either (1) a culturally and linguistically adapted physical activity intervention (Seamos Activas) or (2) a wellness contact control condition.  Main outcome measures  Self-report physical activity, as measured pre- and post-intervention (6 months, 87% retention) by the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall.  Results  Moderate-intensity (or greater) physical activity increased from an average of 16.56 minutes/week (SD=25.76) at baseline to 147.27 (SD=241.55) at 6 months in the intervention arm ( n =45), and from 11.88 minutes/week (SD=21.99) to 96.79 (SD=118.49) in the wellness contact control arm ( n =48). No between-group differences were seen in overall physical activity. Intervention participants reported significantly greater increases in cognitive ( F [1, 91]=9.53,  p =0.003) and behavioral processes of change ( F [1, 91]=8.37,  p =0.005) and available physical activity supplies and equipment at home ( F [1, 91]=4.17,  p =0.04) than control participants.  Conclusions  Results supported the hypothesized feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of individually tailored physical activity print interventions among Latinas. Although more research is needed to corroborate these findings, such high-reach, low-cost approaches have great potential to positively affect public health.

We partnered with the American Cancer Society's Reach to Recovery (RTR) program to train their volunteers (breast cancer survivors) to deliver a 12-week PA intervention to other breast cancer survivors. METHOD We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the PA intervention delivered by RTR volunteers (PA plus RTR) with contact control (RTR control). Eighteen RTR volunteers/coaches (Mage = 54.9 years; Mtime since diagnosis = 7.0 years) delivered the contact control condition or the PA intervention. Seventy-six breast cancer survivors in New England (Mage = 55.6 years; Mtime since diagnosis = 1.1 years) were randomized to 1 of the 2 groups. At baseline, 12 weeks (postintervention), and at 24 weeks, participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days, were interviewed about their PA, and reported their motivational readiness for PA. RESULTS Adjusted, mixed-effects longitudinal regression models showed significant group differences favoring the PA plus RTR group in minutes of moderate to vigorous PA at 12 weeks (Mdifference = 103 min/week, p < .001) and at 24 weeks (Mdifference = 34.7 min/week, p = .03). Results were corroborated with significant group differences in accelerometer data favoring the PA plus RTR group at both time points. CONCLUSION Peer volunteers were able to significantly increase PA among cancer survivors relative to contact control. Partnerships with existing volunteer programs can help to widen the reach of behavioral interventions among cancer survivors.

 Objective  To compare the effectiveness of telephone-delivered interventions on fatigue, physical activity, and quality of life outcomes in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS).  Design  A single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomized to contact-control intervention (CC), physical activity–only intervention (PA-only), and physical activity plus fatigue self-management intervention (FM+). Outcomes were measured at baseline (2wk prerandomization), posttest (14wk postrandomization), and follow-up (26wk postrandomization).  Setting  Telephone-delivered in Midwest and Northeast regions of the United States.  Participants  Inactive adults with MS (N=208) and moderate-to-severe fatigue.  Interventions  Three or 6 group teleconferences followed by 4 individually tailored phone calls delivered during 12 weeks. An occupational therapist and research assistant delivered the teleconferences and tailored phone calls, respectively.  Main Outcome Measures  Primary outcomes were self-report fatigue and physical activity measured with the Fatigue Impact Scale and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, respectively. Secondary outcomes included quality of life measured with the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale and moderate-to-vigorous exercise and step count measured with an accelerometer.  Results  Linear mixed effects models showed FM+ significantly improved self-reported fatigue (β=−11.08; P=.03) and physical activity (β=0.54; P=.01) compared with CC at posttest.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of a combined smartwatch- and social media-based health education intervention on BCS's health outcomes. Thirty BCS ( X ¯ age = 52.6 ± 9.3 years; X ¯ Wt = 80.2 ± 19.6 kg) participated in this 10-week, 2-arm randomized trial, with BCS randomized into: (1) experimental group (n = 16): received Polar M400 smartwatches for daily PA tracking and joined a Facebook group wherein Social Cognitive Theory-related PA tips were provided twice weekly; and (2) comparison group (n = 14): only joined separate, but content-identical Facebook group. Outcomes included PA, physiological, psychosocial, and QoL variables. Specifically, PA and energy expenditure (EE) was assessed by ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers while physiological, psychosocial, and QoL were examined via validated instruments at baseline and post-intervention. No baseline group differences were observed for any variable. Ten BCS dropped out of the study (experimental: 4; comparison: 6). Compared to completers, dropouts differed significantly on several outcomes. Thus, a per-protocol analysis was performed, revealing significant group differences for changes in social support (t = -2.1, p = 0.05) and barriers (t = -2.2, p = 0.04). Interestingly, the comparison group demonstrated improvements for both variables while the intervention group demonstrated slightly decreased social support and no change in barriers. Notably, both groups demonstrated similarly increased daily light PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, EE, and steps of 7.7 min, 5.1 min, 25.1 kcals, and 339 steps, respectively, over time. Despite extensive user training, several experimental BCS found the Polar M400 use difficult-possibly decreasing intervention adherence. Future interventions should utilize simpler smartwatches to promote PA among middle-aged clinical/non-clinical populations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pope Zachary C; Zeng Nan ; Zhang Rui ; Lee Hee Yun; Gao Zan ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/JCM7060140","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pope Zachary C, Zeng Nan, Zhang Rui, Lee Hee Yun, and Gao Zan (2018) Effectiveness of Combined Smartwatch and Social Media Intervention on Breast Cancer Survivor Health Outcomes: A 10-Week Pilot Randomized Trial.

We evaluated the feasibility of a combined smartwatch and theoretically based, social media-delivered health education intervention versus a comparison on improving college students’ health behaviors/outcomes. Thirty-eight students (28 female; Xage = 21.5 ± 3.4 years) participated in this two-arm, randomized 12-week pilot trial (2017–2018). Participants were randomized into: (a) experimental: Polar M400 use and twice-weekly social cognitive theory- and self-determination theory-based Facebook-delivered health education intervention; or (b) comparison: enrollment only in separate, but content-identical, Facebook intervention. Primary outcomes pertained to intervention feasibility. Secondary outcomes included accelerometer-estimated PA, physiological/psychosocial outcomes, and dietary behaviors. Intervention adherence was high (~86%), with a retention of 92.1%. Participants implemented health education tips 1–3 times per week. We observed experimental and comparison groups to have 4.2- and 1.6-min/day increases in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), respectively, at six weeks—partially maintained at 12 weeks. In both groups, similarly decreased body weight (experimental = −0.6 kg; comparison = −0.5 kg) and increased self-efficacy, social support, and intrinsic motivation were observed pre- and post-intervention. Finally, we observed small decreases in daily caloric consumption over time (experimental = −41.0 calories; comparison = −143.3). Both interventions were feasible/of interest to college students and demonstrated initial effectiveness at improving health behaviors/outcomes. However, smartwatch provision may not result in an additional benefit.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pope Zachary C; Barr-Anderson Daheia J; Lewis Beth A; Pereira Mark A; Gao Zan ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/IJERPH16193579","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pope Zachary C, Barr-Anderson Daheia J, Lewis Beth A, Pereira Mark A, and Gao Zan (2019) Use of Wearable Technology and Social Media to Improve Physical Activity and Dietary Behaviors among College Students: A 12-Week Randomized Pilot Study..

In addition the use and appreciation of both interventions are studied. Methods: A three-armed cluster randomized trial was conducted in 2009-2010 with measurements at baseline, one and six months post intervention. School classes were assigned to one of the study arms (YouRaction, YouRAction+e and Generic Information (GI) control group). MVPA was derived from self-reports at baseline, one and six months post intervention. Body Mass Index and waist circumference were measured at baseline and six months post intervention in a random sub-sample of the population. Use of the interventions was measured by webserver logs and appreciation by self-reports. Multilevel regression analyses were conducted to study the effects of the intervention against the GI control group. ANOVA's and chi-square tests were used to describe differences in use and appreciation between study arms. Results: There were no statistically significant intervention effects on compliance with the MVPA guideline, overweight or WC. Access to the full intervention was significantly lower for YouRAction (24.0%) and YouRAction+e (21.7%) compared to the GI (54.4%). Conclusion: This study could not demonstrate that the YouRAction and YouRAction+e interventions were effective in promoting MVPA or improve anthropometric outcomes among adolescents, compared to generic information. Insufficient use and exposure to the intervention content may be an explanation for the lack of effects. © 2012 Prins et al.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Prins Richard Geuchien; Brug Johannes ; van Empelen Pepijn ; Oenema Anke ; Oenema Anke ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0032682","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Prins Richard Geuchien, Brug Johannes, van Empelen Pepijn, Oenema Anke, and Oenema Anke (2012) Effectiveness of YouRAction, an intervention to promote adolescent physical activity using personal and environmental feedback: A cluster RCT.

A randomized trial was undertaken to examine the feasibility of a nutrition and physical activity behavioral intervention among nontraditional undergraduate college students at a large urban public university. Over 8 weeks, participants received either (1) a brief tailored feedback report plus three motivational interviewing-based calls from trained peer counselors (intervention; n = 40) or (2) the report only (control; n = 20). Participants mean age was 32 years (SD = 10), 58 % were female, 47 % were racial/ethnic minorities, and 25 % reported receiving public health insurance. Most (78 %) intervention group participants completed at least two of three peer counseling calls. At follow-up, those in the intervention vs. control group self-reported beneficial, but non-statistically significant changes in fruits and vegetables (+0.7 servings/day), sugary drinks (−6.2 oz/day), and fast food visits (−0.2 visits/week). For physical activity, there was a non-statistically significant decrease in moderate-vigorous physical activity (107.2 min/week) in the intervention vs. control group. Overall satisfaction with the program was high, although there were recommendations made for improving the structure and number of calls. Findings indicate that the intervention was feasible with promising effects on nutrition behaviors and the need to better target physical activity behaviors. Future work entails implementation in a larger sample with objectively measured behaviors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Quintiliani Lisa M; Whiteley Jessica A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/S13187-015-0858-4","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Quintiliani Lisa M, and Whiteley Jessica A (2016) Results of a Nutrition and Physical Activity Peer Counseling Intervention among Nontraditional College Students.

Participants  Children classified at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I-III were recruited (n=37; 18 males; mean age ± SD, 10.0±1.4y) from a population-based register.    Interventions  Participants were randomized to ParticiPAte CP (an 8-wk goal-directed, individualized, participation-focused therapy delivered by a physical therapist) or waitlist usual care.    Main Outcome Measures  The primary outcome was Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Accelerometers were worn for objective measurement of HPA (min/d moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA], sedentary time). Barriers to participation, community participation, and quality-of-life outcomes were also collected. Data were analyzed by intention-to-treat using generalized estimating equations.    Results  ParticiPAte CP led to significant improvements in goal performance (mean difference [MD]=3.58; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.19-4.97; P    Conclusion  ParticiPAte CP was effective at increasing perceived performance of leisure-time physical activity goals in children with CP GMFCS I-III by reducing modifiable barriers to participation. This did not translate into change in HPA on average; however, low active children may have a clinically meaningful response.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Reedman Sarah E; Boyd Roslyn N; Trost Stewart G; Elliott Catherine ; Elliott Catherine ; Sakzewski Leanne ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.APMR.2018.11.012","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Reedman Sarah E, Boyd Roslyn N, Trost Stewart G, Elliott Catherine, Elliott Catherine, and Sakzewski Leanne (2019) Efficacy of Participation-Focused Therapy on Performance of Physical Activity Participation Goals and Habitual Physical Activity in Children With Cerebral Palsy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Family-based interventions to improve moderate-to-vigorous physical activity are essential given that children live within a structure of parental influence. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a parent planning skills intervention to support child physical activity on the subsequent moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (primary outcome) and fitness of their children across 26 weeks (primary endpoint).    Study design  Two-arm randomized trial with physical activity assessment at baseline 6 weeks, 13 weeks, and 26 weeks and fitness and BMI tests at baseline and 26 weeks from 2012 and 2017.    Setting/participants  One hundred and two children (aged 6–12 years) who were below international physical activity recommendations at baseline were recruited through advertisements.    Intervention  Participants received a planning plus education intervention (n=52) or an education-only intervention (n=50).    Main outcome measures  Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was assessed via accelerometry and fitness tests included aerobic fitness, muscular strength, flexibility. BMI was calculated by objectively assessed height and weight.    Results  Generalized linear mixed modeling conducted in 2019 showed that the patterns varied by condition over time (β=−0.05, p    Conclusions  There was initial efficacy of the planning intervention, but effectiveness waned by 26 weeks. These changes appeared to be sufficient for modest changes in aerobic fitness. Future research should aim to improve the maintenance of these early positive changes and assist parents in planning for activities that also include opportunities to improve child musculoskeletal fitness.

Limited intervention success in increasing and sustaining girls' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) underscores a need for continued research. PURPOSE The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a 17-week Girls on the Move (GOTM) intervention on increasing MVPA among fifth- to eighth-grade girls. METHODS This study is a group (cluster) randomized trial, including 24 schools, pair matched and assigned to intervention (n = 12) or control (n = 12) conditions. Participants included 1,519 girls in racially diverse public schools in urban, underserved areas of the Midwestern USA. The intervention included three components: (i) 90-min after-school physical activity (PA) club offered 3 days/week; (ii) two motivational, individually tailored counseling sessions; and (iii) an interactive Internet-based session at the midpoint of the intervention. Main outcome measures were weighted mean minutes of MVPA per week post-intervention and at 9-month follow-up measured via accelerometer. RESULTS No between-group differences occurred for weighted mean minutes of MVPA per week at post-intervention (B = -0.08, p = .207) or 9-month follow-up (B = -0.09, p = .118) while controlling for baseline MVPA. CONCLUSIONS Research is needed to identify interventions that assist girls in attaining and maintaining adequate PA.

  Objective  Although several studies have examined the effect of accumulated bouts on health outcomes, the impact of recommending short bouts on activity-related behavior in health promotion efforts has received minimal investigation.    Method  During this 5-week study in 2007–2008, 43 university employees (8 male, 35 female) in the Southeastern United States were randomly assigned to a group recommended to achieve (a) 10,000 steps (10 K), (b) 30-minutes (30 min) of continuous physical activity, or (c) 30-minutes of activity in bouts of at least 10 minutes (bouts).    Results and conclusions  Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the 10 K group showed the largest increase in step counts whereas the bouts group showed the smallest change over the intervention period,  p  = 0.01. Condition differences were most pronounced on days in which participants met their activity recommendation. Accelerometer results revealed that the 10 K ( d  = 1.1) and 30 min groups ( d  = 0.89) showed large increases in minutes of moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA), whereas the bouts group showed minimal change ( d  = 0.11). Although activity recommendations did not differentially affect self-efficacy, participants from all conditions showed decreased self-efficacy across the intervention ( p  = 0.02), highlighting the need to develop strategies to increase self-efficacy in activity promotion efforts.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Samuels Tiana Y; Raedeke Thomas D; Mahar Matthew T; Karvinen Kristina H; DuBose Katrina D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.YPMED.2010.12.001","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Samuels Tiana Y, Raedeke Thomas D, Mahar Matthew T, Karvinen Kristina H, and DuBose Katrina D (2011) A randomized controlled trial of continuous activity, short bouts, and a 10,000 step guideline in inactive adults.

However, reports indicate that more than half of pregnant women in Iran do not have adequate physical activity. This study was conducted in order to change the behavior of pregnant women in regard to physical activity and also to develop suitable educational/interventional measures. Objectives: This study was conducted to investigate the effects of health belief-based education on the physical activity of nulliparous women. Methods: This triple blinded randomized control trial was conducted among 64 nulliparous women attending the health centers of Ilam, Iran, in 2018. Participants were selected randomly by the cluster sampling method and were allocated to the two groups of control and intervention. Participants in the intervention groups received education and theoretical training based on the health belief model for at least 45 minutes, and then individual practical training was provided. Samples in the control group received routine pregnancy training. Data were collected in two pre-test and post-test stages by a valid questionnaire and were analyzed by SPSS, version 19, using statistical tests, including Chi-square, paired t-test, and independent t-test. Results: The results showed that the levels of perceived sensitivity (-4.750 ± 2.119), (t = 12.215, P ≤ 0.001), perceived severity of threat (-5.312 ± 1.874), (t = -16.036, P < 0.001), perceived benefits (-2.750 ± 1.502), (P < 0.001, t = -10.352), and self-efficacy (-3.656 ± 1.405), (P < 0.001, t = -14.708) in the intervention group significantly increased after the training compared to pre-training. Also, the level of perceived barriers (4.093 ± 1.444), (P < 0.001, t = 16.027) after the training was significantly less than pre-training level. In the intervention group, the total physical activity with the intensity of moderate/severe (2049/000 ± 963.342), (P < 0.001, t = -12.032) was significantly higher than pre-training. Conclusions: The results of this study indicated that training based on the health belief model can increase the physical activity of pregnant women with moderate/severe intensity and bring it to the optimal level of 150 minutes per week by increasing the health beliefs of pregnant women. Therefore, it is suggested that training based on this model should be appropriately incorporated into the routine education of pregnant women.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Taheri Safoura ; Momenimovahed Zohre ; Direkvand-Moghadam Ashraf ; Sharifi Nasibeh ; Farzi Saba ; Shafieian Mahnaz ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5812/SEMJ.101225","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Taheri Safoura, Momenimovahed Zohre, Direkvand-Moghadam Ashraf, Sharifi Nasibeh, Farzi Saba, and Shafieian Mahnaz (2020) The Effect of Health Belief-Based Education on Physical Activates of Nulliparous Women: A Randomized Control Trial.

However, people tend to ‘skim’ and ‘scan’ web-based text rather than thoroughly read their contents. In contrast, online videos are more engaging and popular. We examined whether web-based personally tailored physical activity videos were more effective in promoting physical activity than personally tailored text and generic information.  Methods  501 adults were randomised into a video-tailored intervention, text-tailored intervention or control. Over a 3-month period, intervention groups received access to eight sessions of web-based personally tailored physical activity advice. Only the delivery method differed between intervention groups: tailored video versus tailored text. The primary outcome was 7-day ActiGraph-GT3X+ measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) assessed at 0, 3 and 9 months. Secondary outcomes included self-reported MVPA and website engagement. Differences were examined using generalised linear mixed models with intention-to-treat and multiple imputation.  Results  Accelerometer-assessed MVPA increased 23% in the control (1.23 (1.06, 1.43)), 12% in the text-tailored (1.12 (0.95, 1.32)) and 28% in the video-tailored (1.28 (1.06, 1.53)) groups at the 3-month follow-up only, though there were no significant between-group differences. Both text-tailored (1.77 (1.37, 2.28]) and video-tailored (1.37 (1.04, 1.79)) groups significantly increased self-reported MVPA more than the control group at 3 months only, but there were no differences between video-tailored and text-tailored groups. The video-tailored group spent significantly more time on the website compared with text-tailored participants (90 vs 77 min, p=0.02).  Conclusions  The personally tailored videos were not more effective than personally tailored text in increasing MVPA. The findings from this study conflict with pilot study outcomes and previous literature. Process evaluation and mediation analyses will provide further insights.

Objectives:  The objective of this study was to compare a tailored intervention based on the Health Promotion Model with a generic intervention to increase physical activity and healthy eating among rural women.  Methods:  In a randomized-by-site, community-based, controlled, clinical trial, Wellness for Women, 225 women aged 50 to 69 years were recruited in two similar rural areas. Over 12 months, women received by mail either 18 generic newsletters or 18 newsletters computer tailored on Health Promotion Model behavior-specific cognitions (benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, and interpersonal support), activity, and eating. Outcomes at 6 and 12 months included behavioral markers and biomarkers of physical activity and eating. Data were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance and chi-square tests (α   Results:  Both groups significantly increased stretching and strengthening exercise and fruit and vegetable servings and decreased percentage of calories from fat, whereas only the tailored group increased moderate or greater intensity activity and decreased percentage of calories from saturated fat from baseline to 6 months. Both groups increased stretching and strengthening exercise, whereas only the tailored group increased moderate or greater intensity activity and fruit and vegetable servings and decreased percentage of calories from fat from baseline to 12 months. Both groups had several changes in biomarkers over the study. A higher proportion of women receiving tailored newsletters met Healthy People 2010 criteria for moderate or greater intensity activity, fruit and vegetable servings, and percentage of calories from fat at 12 months.  Discussion:  Mailed computer-tailored and generic print newsletters facilitated the adoption of change in both activity and eating over 6 months. Tailored newsletters were more efficacious in facilitating change over 12 months.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Walker Susan Noble; Pullen Carol H; Boeckner Linda ; Hageman Patricia A; Hertzog Melody ; Oberdorfer Maureen K; Rutledge Matthew J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/NNR.0B013E31818FCEE1","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Walker Susan Noble, Pullen Carol H, Boeckner Linda, Hageman Patricia A, Hertzog Melody, Oberdorfer Maureen K, and Rutledge Matthew J (2009) Clinical trial of tailored activity and eating newsletters with older rural women..

Our purpose was to determine long-term maintenance of physical activity (PA) following the 48-week Women's Lifestyle PA program, targeted/tailored for African-American women. METHODS The parent study consisted of a 3-arm randomized clinical trial with 3 assessment points: baseline (pre-intervention); 24 weeks post-baseline (end active intervention); and 48 weeks post-baseline (end maintenance intervention). Present analyses supplement the original results by adding a long-term maintenance assessment that occurred 2 to 4 years post-baseline. Participants were 288 African-American women aged 40 to 65 without major signs/symptoms of pulmonary/cardiovascular disease. The active intervention included 5 group meetings, with 9 personal motivational calls, 9 automated motivational calls, or no calls between meetings. The maintenance intervention included one group meeting and either 2 calls or no calls. PA was assessed with the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors. RESULTS Retention was 90%. Over long-term maintenance, there was a decline in PA, but levels remained significantly higher than baseline for moderate/vigorous PA (p < .001), leisure moderate/vigorous PA (p < .001) and walking (p = .006). Variations by condition/site were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that long-term maintenance of PA increases resulting from group meetings in an active intervention occur when followed by a maintenance intervention.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wilbur JoEllen ; Miller Arlene M; Buchholz Susan W; Fogg Louis F; Braun Lynne T; Halloway Shannon ; Schoeny Michael E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5993/AJHB.41.4.13","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wilbur JoEllen, Miller Arlene M, Buchholz Susan W, Fogg Louis F, Braun Lynne T, Halloway Shannon, and Schoeny Michael E (2017) African-American Women's Long-term Maintenance of Physical Activity Following a Randomized Controlled Trial..

 Faith-based interventions hold promise for promoting health in ethnic minority populations. To date, however, few of these interventions have used a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, have targeted both physical activity and healthy eating, and have focused on structural changes in the church.  Purpose  To report the results of a group randomized CBPR intervention targeting physical activity and healthy eating in African-American churches.  Design  Group RCT. Data were collected from 2007 to 2011. Statistical analyses were conducted in 2012.  Setting/participants  Seventy-four African Methodist Episcopal (AME) churches in South Carolina and 1257 members within them participated in the study.  Intervention  Churches were randomized to an immediate (intervention) or delayed (control) 15-month intervention that targeted organizational and environmental changes consistent with the structural ecologic model. A CBPR approach guided intervention development. Intervention churches attended a full-day committee training and a full-day cook training. They also received a stipend and 15 months of mailings and technical assistance calls to support intervention implementation.  Main outcome measures  Primary outcomes were self-reported moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA), self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption, and measured blood pressure. Secondary outcomes were self-reported fat- and fiber-related behaviors. Measurements were taken at baseline and 15 months. Intent-to-treat repeated measures ANOVA tested group X time interactions, controlling for church clustering, wave, and size, and participant age, gender, and education. Post hoc ANCOVAs were conducted with measurement completers.  Results  There was a significant effect favoring the intervention group in self-reported leisure-time MVPA (d=0.18,  p =0.02), but no effect for other outcomes. ANCOVA analyses showed an intervention effect for self-reported leisure-time MVPA (d=0.17,  p =0.03) and self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption (d=0.17,  p =0.03). Trainings were evaluated very positively (training evaluation item means of 4.2–4.8 on a 5-point scale).  Conclusions  This faith-based structural intervention using a CBPR framework showed small but significant increases in self-reported leisure-time MVPA. This program has potential for broad-based dissemination and reach.  Trial registration  This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT00379925.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wilcox Sara ; Parrott Allen ; Baruth Meghan ; Laken Marilyn ; Condrasky Margaret ; Saunders Ruth ; Dowda Marsha ; Evans Rebecca ; Addy Cheryl ; Warren Tatiana Y; Kinnard Deborah ; Zimmerman Lakisha ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.AMEPRE.2012.09.062","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wilcox Sara, Parrott Allen, Baruth Meghan, Laken Marilyn, Condrasky Margaret, Saunders Ruth, Dowda Marsha, Evans Rebecca, Addy Cheryl, Warren Tatiana Y, Kinnard Deborah, and Zimmerman Lakisha (2013) The Faith, Activity, and Nutrition program: a randomized controlled trial in African-American churches..

Objectives  To describe the potential effect of an intervention to increase sleep on young children's (3-6 years) moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) and total PA. To determine adherence to the intervention, impact on sleep duration as well as feasibility, uptake and acceptability was also assessed.  Methods  Pilot randomized controlled trial with 76 parent-child dyads randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 38) or control group (n = 38). Parents in the intervention group received a 3-month theory-informed intervention consisting of an online video, a telephone call and two text messages. Child PA was assessed using accelerometers at baseline and approximately 3 months. Parents also completed a sleep log and a telephone interview.  Results  The consent rate was 41% (76/186). Estimated effect size for the intervention relative to control was 10.8 min/day for MVPA, 2.7 min/day for PA and 0.9 h for sleep. Sixteen (44%) parents accessed the video, and 18 (50%) received the telephone call. Over 40% of parents found the video and telephone call useful/very useful.  Conclusions  This study reports promising effects that an intervention targeting sleep may improve child MVPA and sleep duration. Some modifications to data collection methods and intervention delivery are needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yoong S L; Grady A ; Stacey F ; Polimeni M ; Clayton O ; Jones J ; Nathan N ; Wyse R ; Wolfenden L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/IJPO.12481","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yoong S L, Grady A, Stacey F, Polimeni M, Clayton O, Jones J, Nathan N, Wyse R, and Wolfenden L (2019) A pilot randomized controlled trial examining the impact of a sleep intervention targeting home routines on young children's (3-6 years) physical activity..

and prediabetes are chronic conditions that affect over 40% of the US adult population combined. Regular physical activity can benefit people with diabetes through improved glucose control and can reduce the conversion of prediabetes to diabetes. Studies are needed in settings where people with these conditions can be identified and provided the skills and support to increase physical activity. The primary care setting meets this need, but there are insufficient high-quality trials to recommend this approach be broadly implemented. We conducted a randomized, 24-week pilot study in Southern California to assess the feasibility of using information technology systems available in primary care for identifying potential participants, test methods for obtaining physical activity clearance, conducting mail-based assessments, and delivering telephone-based motivational interviewing to increase physical activity. Eligibility criteria included age between 18 and 74 years, diabetes or prediabetes, and physically inactive based on a clinical assessment tool. At baseline and follow-up, physical activity was assessed by a 7-day accelerometry, cardiometabolic risk factors were collected from electronic medical records, and psychosocial factors were assessed from validated questionnaires administered through a mail survey. Participants were block randomized into intervention or usual care. Staff collecting outcome data were blinded to group assignment. Analysis of covariance was used to assess the difference at follow-up between the intervention and usual care, adjusting for baseline. A total of 67 participants were randomized. Follow-up mail assessments were completed by 53 participants. Of 224 potential intervention calls, 194 were completed (87%). Psychosocial measures significantly improved in four of the five factors for physical activity motivation relative to participants in the usual care arm. The more internally focused factors for exercise self-regulation and outcome expectancies scores were significantly greater for participants in intervention compared with usual care. Moderate to vigorous physical activity improved in intervention participants relative to usual care, but the difference was not statistically significant. No adverse events were noted. The objectives of this pilot study were met. If a fully powered trial is successful, primary care settings with “behind-the-scenes” information technology support may be appropriate to increase physical activity among patients with prediabetes and diabetes.
