A risk ratio of one means there is no difference between two groups in terms of their risk of cancer, based on whether or not they were exposed to a certain substance or factor, or how they responded to two treatments being compared. A risk ratio of greater than one or of less than one usually means that being exposed to a certain substance or factor either increases (risk ratio greater than one) or decreases (risk ratio less than one) the risk of cancer, or that the treatments being compared do not have the same effects.","AttributeType":"Selectable (show checkbox)","AttributeName":"Risk Ratio"},{"AttributeDescription":"","ExtURL":"","ExtType":"","OriginalAttributeID":0,"AttributeSetId":7138098,"AttributeId":7138189,"AttributeSetDescription":"The absolute difference in probability that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared with the probability of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure.","AttributeType":"Selectable (show checkbox)","AttributeName":"Risk Difference"},{"AttributeDescription":"","ExtURL":"","ExtType":"","OriginalAttributeID":0,"AttributeSetId":7138099,"AttributeId":7138190,"AttributeSetDescription":"The absolute difference between the mean value of two sets of numbers.","AttributeType":"Selectable (show checkbox)","AttributeName":"Mean Difference"},{"AttributeDescription":"","ExtURL":"","ExtType":"","OriginalAttributeID":0,"AttributeSetId":7138100,"AttributeId":7138191,"AttributeSetDescription":"The absolute difference between the median value of two sets of numbers.","AttributeType":"Selectable (show checkbox)","AttributeName":"Median Difference"},{"AttributeDescription":"","ExtURL":"","ExtType":"","OriginalAttributeID":0,"AttributeSetId":7138101,"AttributeId":7138192,"AttributeSetDescription":"A measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in another group, over time.

The study tested the effectiveness of a 12-month tailored intervention to increase MVPA in women with infants 2–12 months old.    Methods  From 2008 to 2011, women ( n  = 311) with infants (average age = 5.7 months) from Honolulu, Hawaii were randomly assigned to receive tailored telephone calls and access to a mom-centric website ( n  = 154) or access to a standard PA website ( n  = 157). MVPA was measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months using self-report and acclerometers.    Results  Controlling for covariates, the tailored condition significantly increased self-reported MVPA from an average of 44 to 246 min/week compared with 46 to 156 min/week for the standard condition ( p  = 0.027). Mothers with ≥ 2 children had significantly greater increases in MVPA in response to the tailored intervention than those with one child ( p  = 0.016). Accelerometer-measured MVPA significantly increased over time ( p  = 0.0001), with no condition differences. There was evidence of reactivity to initially wearing accelerometers; the tailored intervention significantly increased MVPA among women with low baseline accelerometer MVPA minutes, but not among those with high minutes ( p  interaction  = 0.053).    Conclusion  A tailored intervention effectively increased MVPA over 12 months in multiethnic women with infants, particularly those with more than one child.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Albright Cheryl L; Steffen Alana D; Steffen Alana D; Wilkens Lynne R; White Kami K; Novotny Rachel ; Nigg Claudio R; Saiki Kara ; Brown Wendy J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.YPMED.2014.09.019","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Albright Cheryl L, Steffen Alana D, Steffen Alana D, Wilkens Lynne R, White Kami K, Novotny Rachel, Nigg Claudio R, Saiki Kara, and Brown Wendy J (2014) Effectiveness of a 12-month randomized clinical trial to increase physical activity in multiethnic postpartum women: results from Hawaii's Nā Mikimiki Project..

investigate the long-term effectiveness of a school-based intervention to improve physical activity and diet in children.  Design  Cluster-randomised controlled trial.  Setting  60 primary schools in the southwest of England.  Participants  Primary school children who were aged 8–9 years at recruitment, 9–10 years during the intervention and 10–11 years at the long-term follow-up assessment.  Intervention  Teacher training, provision of lesson and child–parent interactive homework plans and teaching materials.  Main outcome measures  Primary outcomes were accelerometer-assessed minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day, accelerometer-assessed minutes of sedentary behaviour per day and reported daily consumption of servings of fruit and vegetables.  Results  60 schools with 2221 eligible children were recruited. As in the previously published assessment immediately after the end of the intervention, none of the three primary outcomes differed between children in schools allocated to the intervention, compared with those in control schools at the end of the long-term follow-up (1 year after the end of the intervention). Differences in secondary outcomes were consistent with those at the immediate follow-up, with no evidence that these had diminished over time. Comparing intervention with control schools, the difference in mean child-reported screen viewing at the weekend was −16.03 min (95% CI −32.82 to 0.73), for servings of snacks per day, the difference was −0.11 (95% CI −0.39 to 0.06), in servings of high-energy drinks per day −0.20 (95% CI −0.39 to −0.01) and in servings of high-fat foods per day −0.12 (95% CI −0.39 to 0.00). None of these reached our predefined level of statistical significance, especially after accounting for multiple testing.  Conclusions  School-based curriculum interventions alone are unlikely to have a major public health impact on children9s diet and physical activity.  Trial registration number  ISRCTN50133740, Post-results.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Anderson Emma L; Howe Laura D; Kipping Ruth R; Campbell Rona ; Jago Russell ; Noble Sian M; Noble Sian M; Wells Sian ; Chittleborough Catherine ; Peters Tim J; Lawlor Debbie A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1136/BMJOPEN-2015-010957","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Anderson Emma L, Howe Laura D, Kipping Ruth R, Campbell Rona, Jago Russell, Noble Sian M, Noble Sian M, Wells Sian, Chittleborough Catherine, Peters Tim J, and Lawlor Debbie A (2016) Long-term effects of the Active for Life Year 5 (AFLY5) school-based cluster-randomised controlled trial.

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Subjects were 8- to 12-year-olds recruited from elementary schools. Body composition was measured using anthropometrics {waist circumference and BMI, DXA [percentage body fat (%BF)] and bone mineral density (BMD)}, and magnetic resonance imaging [visceral adipose tissue (VAT)]. CV fitness was measured using a graded treadmill test. The intervention consisted of 30 minutes homework/healthy snack time and 80 minutes PA (i.e., 25 minutes skills instruction, 35 minutes aerobic PA, and 20 minutes strengthening/stretching). Analyses were adjusted for age, baseline value of the dependent variable, and sexual maturation (pediatrician observation). RESULTS: Mean attendance was 54%. Compared with the control group, the intervention group had a relative decrease in %BF (p < 0.0001), BMI (p < 0.01), and VAT (p < 0.01) and a relative increase in BMD (p < 0.0001) and CV fitness (p < 0.05). Higher attendance was associated with greater increases in BMD (p < 0.05) and greater decreases in %BF (p < 0.01) and BMI (p < 0.05). Higher heart rate during PA was associated with greater increases in BMD (p < 0.05) and greater decreases in %BF (p < 0.005). DISCUSSION: An after-school PA program can lead to beneficial changes in body composition and CV fitness in young black girls. It is noteworthy that the control and intervention groups differed in change in VAT but not waist circumference. This suggests that changes in central adiposity can occur in response to PA, even in young children, but that waist circumference may not be a good indicator of central adiposity.","Comments":"Barbeau, Paule Johnson, Maribeth H Howe, Cheryl A Allison, Jerry Davis, Catherine L Gutin, Bernard Lemmon, Christian R R01 HL064972/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States HL64972/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Randomized Controlled Trial Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural United States Obesity (Silver Spring). 2007 Aug;15(8):2077-85. doi: 10.1038/oby.2007.247.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barbeau P ; Johnson M H; Howe C A; Allison J ; Davis C L; Gutin B ; Lemmon C R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/oby.2007.247","Keywords":"Absorptiometry, Photon\r\n*African Americans\r\nBody Composition/physiology\r\nBone Density/*physiology\r\nChild\r\nExercise/*physiology\r\nExercise Test\r\nFemale\r\nHeart Rate/physiology\r\nHumans\r\nIntra-Abdominal Fat/*physiology\r\nOxygen Consumption/physiology\r\nPhysical Fitness/*physiology\r\nStatistics, Nonparametric","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barbeau P, Johnson M H, Howe C A, Allison J, Davis C L, Gutin B, and Lemmon C R (2007) Ten months of exercise improves general and visceral adiposity, bone, and fitness in black girls.

Providing intervention materials via the internet would have the potential to reach more families but may increase sedentary behavior. The purpose was to evaluate whether delivering the AOM Family Intervention via the internet versus printed workbook would have a similar impact on sedentary behaviors in children. Methods: 131 children (age 8–12) were randomized to receive the AOM Family Intervention via the internet or workbook for 12 weeks. Changes in objectively measured sedentary time and moderate-to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as well as self-reported screen time were compared between groups. Results: There were no significant differences between groups in screen time, sedentary time, or MVPA at the end of the 12 week intervention. Families receiving the intervention via the internet were more likely to remain in the study (98% vs. 82%, P = .016).

Methods  People who had undergone a unilateral TKR and were receiving outpatient physical therapy (PT) were randomized to a control or intervention group. Both groups received standard PT for TKR. The intervention included being provided with a Fitbit Zip, step goals, and 1 phone call a month for 6 months after discharge from PT. Feasibility was measured by rates of recruitment and retention, safety was measured by the frequency of adverse events, and fidelity was measured by adherence to the weekly steps/day goal created by the physical therapist and participant monitoring of steps/day. An Actigraph GT3X measured PA, which was quantified as steps/day and minutes/week of engaging in moderate-to-vigorous PA. Our preliminary outcome was the difference in PA 6 months after discharge from PT between the control and intervention groups.  Results  Of the 43 individuals who were enrolled, 53.4% were women, the mean ± SD age was 67.0 ± 7.0 years, and the mean ± SD body mass index was 31.5 ± 5.9 kg/m2 . For both the control and intervention groups, the recruitment and retention rates were 64% and 83.7%, respectively, and adherence to the intervention ranged from 45% to 60%. No study-related adverse events occurred. The patients in the intervention group accumulated a mean 1,798 more steps/day (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 240, 3,355) and spent 73.4 more minutes/week (95% CI -14.1, 160.9) engaging in moderate-to-vigorous PA at 6 months than those in the control group.  Conclusion  A physical therapist-administered PA intervention is feasible and safe, demonstrates treatment fidelity, and may increase PA after TKR.

Uptake of CR remains suboptimal (30% of eligible patients), and long-term adherence to a physically active lifestyle is even lower. Innovative strategies are needed to counteract this phenomenon. OBJECTIVE The Physical Activity Toward Health (PATHway) system was developed to provide a comprehensive, remotely monitored, home-based CR program for CVD patients. The PATHway-I study aimed to investigate its feasibility and clinical efficacy during phase III CR. METHODS Participants were randomized on a 1:1 basis to the PATHway (PW) intervention group or usual care (UC) control group in a single-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled pilot trial. Outcomes were assessed at completion of phase II CR and 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was physical activity (PA; Actigraph GT9X link). Secondary outcomes included measures of physical fitness, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, endothelial function, intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery, and quality of life. System usability and patients' experiences were evaluated only in PW. A mixed-model analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustment was used to analyze between-group effects over time. Missing values were handled by means of an intention-to-treat analysis. Statistical significance was set at a 2-sided alpha level of .05. Data are reported as mean (SD). RESULTS A convenience sample of 120 CVD patients (mean 61.4 years, SD 13.5 years; 22 women) was included. The PATHway system was deployed in the homes of 60 participants. System use decreased over time and system usability was average with a score of 65.7 (SD 19.7; range 5-100). Moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA increased in PW (PW: 127 [SD 58] min to 141 [SD 69] min, UC: 146 [SD 66] min to 143 [SD 71] min; Pinteraction=.04; effect size of 0.42), while diastolic blood pressure (PW: 79 [SD 11] mmHg to 79 [SD 10] mmHg, UC: 78 [SD 9] mmHg to 83 [SD 10] mmHg; Pinteraction=.004; effect size of -0.49) and cardiovascular risk score (PW: 15.9% [SD 10.4%] to 15.5% [SD 10.5%], UC: 14.5 [SD 9.7%] to 15.7% [SD 10.9%]; Pinteraction=.004; effect size of -0.36) remained constant, but deteriorated in UC. CONCLUSIONS This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a technology-enabled, remotely monitored, home-based CR program. Although clinical effectiveness was demonstrated, several challenges were identified that could influence the adoption of PATHway.

2 intervention; 1 control school(s)).\n\nParticipants 460 participants (46.6% female; 13.2 (0.4) years old).\n\nInterventions 8-week intervention (2013) involved: classes choosing weekly activities encouraged by mentors (older adolescents) and in-class peer leaders. Students gain points for trying activities which are entered into an intramural competition.\n\nPrimary and secondary outcome measures Planned quantitative (questionnaire) and qualitative (focus groups) process evaluation addressed enjoyment, confidence, participation, suggested improvements. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and follow-up (week 8) in pilot CRCT and included accelerometer-assessed MVPA; adolescent-reported activity type, well-being, peer support, shyness, sociability. Analysis of covariance was used to assess preliminary effectiveness as change in MVPA adjusted for baseline.\n\nResults All year 9 students in intervention schools were exposed to the intervention; over all schools 77% of eligible students were measured. 71% boys and 74% girls found GoActive ‘fun’; 38% boys and 32% girls said it increased confidence, and 64% boys and 59% girls said they would continue with a GoActive activity. Suggested improvements included more mentorship; improved training; streamlined points recording. Pilot results indicated potential effectiveness ((adjusted mean difference (95% CI) p value; MVPA mins; 5.1 (1.1 to 9.2) p=0.014)) and suggest recruitment of 16 schools (2400 adolescents) for a full trial. Compared with control, intervention students reported greater peer support 0.5 (0.1 to 0.9) p=0.03, well-being 1.8 (0.1 to 3.4) p=0.04 but no difference in shyness/sociability. Participation in activity types approached significance (intervention group 2.3 (−0.2 to 4.7) p=0.07 more activity types).\n\nConclusions Results suggest feasibility and indicate potential effectiveness of GoActive to increase MVPA and support a fully powered evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

The determinants of physical activity in adolescents are multilevel and poorly understood, but the school’s social environment likely plays an important role. We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a school-based programme (GoActive) to increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among adolescents.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods and findings \r\nNon-fee-paying, co-educational schools including Year 9 students in the UK counties of Cambridgeshire and Essex were eligible for inclusion. Within participating schools (n = 16), all Year 9 students were eligible and invited to participate. Participants were 2,862 13- to 14-year-olds (84% of eligible students). After baseline assessment, schools were computer-randomised, stratified by school-level pupil premium funding (below/above county-specific median) and county (control: 8 schools, 1,319 participants, mean [SD] participants per school n = 165 [62]; intervention: 8 schools, 1,543 participants, n = 193 [43]). Measurement staff were blinded to allocation. The iteratively developed, feasibility-tested 12-week intervention, aligned with self-determination theory, trained older adolescent mentors and in-class peer-leaders to encourage classes to conduct 2 new weekly activities. Students and classes gained points and rewards for engaging in any activity in or out of school. The primary outcome was average daily minutes of accelerometer-assessed MVPA at 10-month follow-up; a mixed-methods process evaluation evaluated implementation. Of 2,862 recruited participants (52.1% male), 2,167 (76%) attended 10-month follow-up measurements; we analysed the primary outcome for 1,874 participants (65.5%). At 10 months, there was a mean (SD) decrease in MVPA of 8.3 (19.3) minutes in the control group and 10.4 (22.7) minutes in the intervention group (baseline-adjusted difference [95% confidence interval] −1.91 minutes [−5.53 to 1.70], p = 0.316). The programme cost £13 per student compared with control; it was not cost-effective. Overall, 62.9% of students and 87.3% of mentors reported that GoActive was fun. Teachers and mentors commented that their roles in programme delivery were unclear. Implementation fidelity was low. The main methodological limitation of this study was the relatively affluent and ethnically homogeneous sample.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions \r\nIn this study, we observed that a rigorously developed school-based intervention was no more effective than standard school practice at preventing declines in adolescent physical activity. Interdisciplinary research is required to understand educational-setting-specific implementation challenges. School leaders and authorities should be realistic about expectations of the effect of school-based physical activity promotion strategies implemented at scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrial registration \r\nISRCTN Registry ISRCTN31583496.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Corder Kirsten ; Sharp Stephen J; Jong Stephanie T; Jong Stephanie T; Foubister Campbell ; Brown Helen Elizabeth; Wells Emma K; Armitage Sofie M; Croxson Caroline H.

Participants: 42 students, in the contemplation stage at baseline, were randomly assigned to an experimental group (16 women, 2 men; M age = 19.1 ± 1.15) and a control group (18 women, 2 men; M age = 20.1 ± 5.7). Methods: Physical activity was measured at different moments by accelerometry. Other cognitive variables were measured by self-reported scales. Results: We did not find any significant increases in students’ physical activity in favor of the intervention group. Intragroup analyses indicate that the intervention has an effect on physical activity (moderate-to-vigorous physical activity), basic psychological needs, and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Conclusions: Results partially demonstrate that applying social cognitive theories seems to be effective in improving physical activity and cognitive variables in university students in the contemplation stage","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Corella Cristina ; Zaragoza Javier ; Julián José Antonio; Rodríguez-Ontiveros Víctor Hugo; Medrano Carlos Tomás; Plaza Inmaculada ; Abarca-Sos Alberto ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/IJERPH16224368","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Corella Cristina, Zaragoza Javier, Julián José Antonio, Rodríguez-Ontiveros Víctor Hugo, Medrano Carlos Tomás, Plaza Inmaculada, and Abarca-Sos Alberto (2019) Improving Physical Activity Levels and Psychological Variables on University Students in the Contemplation Stage..

and age, women over the age of 25 are at an increased risk for sedentary behavior. Childbearing and motherhood have been explored as one possible explanation for this increased risk. Post natal exercise studies to date demonstrate promising physical and psychological outcomes, however few physical activity interventions have been theory-driven and tailored to post natal exercise initiates. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a group-mediated cognitive behavioral intervention based upon social-cognitive theory and group dynamics (GMCB) to a standard care postnatal exercise program (SE). METHOD: A randomized, two-arm intervention design was used. Fifty-seven post natal women were randomized to one of two conditions: (1) a standard exercise treatment (SE) and (2) a standard exercise treatment plus group-mediated cognitive behavioral intervention (GMCB). Participants in both conditions participated in a four-week intensive phase where participants received standard exercise training. In addition, GMCB participants received self-regulatory behavioral skills training via six group-mediated counseling sessions. Following the intensive phase, participants engaged in a four-week home-based phase of self-structured exercise. Measures of physical activity, barrier efficacy, and proximal outcome expectations were administered and data were analyzed using ANCOVA procedures. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: ANCOVA of change scores for frequency, minutes, and volume of physical activity revealed significant treatment effects over the intensive and home-based phases (p's < 0.01). In addition, ANCOVA of change in mean barrier efficacy and proximal outcome expectations at the conclusion of the intensive phase demonstrated that GMCB participants increased their initial level of barrier efficacy and outcome expectations while SE participants decreased (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: While both exercise programs resulted in improvements to exercise participation, the GMCB intervention produced greater improvement in overall physical activity, barrier efficacy and proximal outcome expectations.","Comments":"Cramp, Anita G Brawley, Lawrence R England Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act. 2006 Aug 22;3:23. doi: 10.1186/1479-5868-3-23.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cramp A G; Brawley L R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1479-5868-3-23","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cramp A G, and Brawley L R (2006) Moms in motion: a group-mediated cognitive-behavioral physical activity intervention.

Structured after-school PA programing is one approach to help increase activity levels. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and short-term impact of a supervised after-school PA and nutrition education program on activity levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods \r\nForty-two 3rd-5th graders from an inner-city school in Boston, MA were randomly assigned to a 10-wk after-school program of either: 1) weekly nutrition education, or 2) weekly nutrition education plus supervised PA 3 d.wk-1 at a community-based center. At baseline and follow-up, PA was measured using accelerometry and fitness (VO2max) was estimated using the PACER 15-m shuttle run. Additional measures obtained were non-fasting finger stick total cholesterol (TC) and glucose levels, waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), percent body fat (%BF), and blood pressure (BP). Values are presented as mean±SE, unless noted otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nResults \r\nThirty-six participants completed the study (mean±SD; age 9.7±0.9 years). Participants attended >80% of the sessions. After adjusting for accelerometer wear time and other design factors, light and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) increased in the nutrition+PA group (+21.5±14.5 and +8.6±8.0 min.d-1, respectively) and decreased in the nutrition only group (-35.2±16.3 and -16.0±9.0 min.d-1, respectively); mean difference between groups of 56.8±21.7 min.d-1 (light PA, p = 0.01) and 24.5±12.0 min.d-1 (MVPA, p = 0.04). Time spent in sedentary behaviors declined in the nutrition+PA group (-14.8±20.7 min.d-1) and increased in the nutrition only group (+55.4±23.2 min.d-1); mean difference between groups of -70.2±30.9 min.d-1 (p = 0.02). Neither group showed changes in TC, BP, WC, %BF, BMI percentile, or fitness (p>0.05).\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions \r\nThe supervised afterschool community-based nutrition and PA program was well accepted and had high attendance. The changes in light PA and MVPA has potential to promote weight maintenance in inner-city elementary school children, however longer term studies with larger samples are needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrial Registration \r\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01104038","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Crouter Scott E; de Ferranti Sarah D; Whiteley Jessica ; Steltz Sarah K; Osganian Stavroula K; Feldman Henry A; Hayman Laura L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0141584","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Crouter Scott E, de Ferranti Sarah D, Whiteley Jessica, Steltz Sarah K, Osganian Stavroula K, Feldman Henry A, and Hayman Laura L (2015) Effect on Physical Activity of a Randomized Afterschool Intervention for Inner City Children in 3rd to 5th Grade.

The present study investigates the effect of the Activ-O-Meter, an internet-based computer-tailored physical activity intervention in adolescents in six European centers involved in the HELENA study.\r\nMethods: Adolescents (12-17 years old) from Vienna, Ghent, Heraklion, Dortmund, Athens, and Stockholm were randomized into intervention and control schools. Participants in the intervention condition received the computer-tailored advice at baseline and after 1 month. Participants in the control condition received a generic standard advice. Effects were evaluated after 1 (n = 675) and 3 months (n = 494) using multi-level modeling. Physical activity levels were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire for adolescents (IPAQ-A).\r\n\r\nResults: After 1 month, the intervention group reported higher levels of moderate (beta = -32.8, 95% CI (confidence interval): -64.2 to -1.4) and vigorous (beta = -28.0, 95% CI: -50.7 to -5.3) physical activity in leisure time, as well as higher levels of cycling for transport (beta = -19.1, 95% CI: -34.4 to -7.6) compared to the control group. After 3 months, when the intervention group had received the tailored feedback twice, intervention effects were even stronger. Favorable changes in physical activity levels of all intensities and in different contexts were found in the tailored group compared to the control group. Among adolescents not reaching the physical activity recommendations at baseline similar effects as in the total sample were found.\r\n\r\nConclusions: The data indicated that the computer-tailored physical activity intervention had positive effects on physical activity levels among the adolescents. However, the implementation of the computer-tailored intervention in the schools was not feasible in all countries.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"De Bourdeaudhuij Ilse ; Maes Lea ; De Henauw Stefaan ; De Vriendt Tineke ; Moreno Luis A; Kersting Mathilde ; Sarri Katerina ; Manios Yannis ; Widhalm Kurt ; Sjöstrom Michael ; Ruiz Jonatan R; Haerens Leen ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.JADOHEALTH.2009.10.006","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"De Bourdeaudhuij Ilse, Maes Lea, De Henauw Stefaan, De Vriendt Tineke, Moreno Luis A, Kersting Mathilde, Sarri Katerina, Manios Yannis, Widhalm Kurt, Sjöstrom Michael, Ruiz Jonatan R, and Haerens Leen (2010) Evaluation of a Computer-Tailored Physical Activity Intervention in Adolescents in Six European Countries: The Activ-O-Meter in the HELENA Intervention Study.

  Question  Does adding weekly, physiotherapist-delivered motivational interviewing to outpatient oncology rehabilitation for cancer survivors increase physical activity levels and improve physical and psychosocial outcomes that are typically impaired in this cohort?    Design  Randomised controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment, concealed allocation and intention-to-treat analysis.    Participants  A heterogeneous sample of 46 cancer survivors (n = 29 female; mean age 59 years) participating in a public outpatient oncology rehabilitation program.    Intervention  Participants were randomly allocated to receive oncology rehabilitation (n = 24) or oncology rehabilitation with motivational interviewing delivered once weekly for 7 weeks via telephone by a physiotherapist (n = 22).    Outcome measures  The primary outcome was amount of physical activity of at least moderate intensity completed in 10-minute bouts, measured by an accelerometer worn continuously for 1 week. Secondary outcomes included other measures of physical activity, sedentary behaviour, physical function, psychosocial function, and quality of life.    Results  When added to oncology rehabilitation, motivational interviewing caused no appreciable increase in the amount of moderate-intensity physical activity (MD –1.2 minutes/day, 95% CI –2.5 to 0.02). Among many secondary outcomes, the only statistically significant result was a small effect on nausea, which probably represents a Type I error. However, several secondary outcomes related to lower-intensity physical activity had non-significant confidence intervals that included large effects such as: sedentary time (SMD –0.67, 95% CI –1.32 to 0.02), light-intensity physical activity (SMD 0.56, 95% CI –0.12 to 1.21) and daily step count (SMD 0.37, 95% CI –0.30 to 1.02).    Conclusion  Adding motivational interviewing to oncology rehabilitation did not increase moderate-intensity physical activity. Favourable trends on measures of lower-intensity physical activity suggest that motivational interviewing should be further investigated for its effects on reducing sedentary time and improving light-intensity physical activity for cancer survivors participating in rehabilitation.

Objective  To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an individually tailored, Internet-plus-email physical activity intervention designed for adult women.    Method  Healthy and ethnically-diverse adult females ( N  = 156) (mean age = 42.8 years, 65% Caucasian) from California were randomly assigned to an intervention (access to a tailored website and weekly emails) or wait-list control group. Participants completed web-based assessments of physical activity, stage of behavior change, and psychosocial variables at baseline, one month, two months, and three months. Data were collected during 2006–2007. Multilevel random coefficient modeling examined group differences in rates of change.    Results  As compared to the control condition, the intervention group increased walking (+ 69 versus + 32 min per week) and total moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (+ 23 versus − 25 min per week) after three months. The intervention did not impact stage of behavior change or any of the other psychosocial variables.    Conclusion  A tailored, Internet-based intervention for adult women had a positive effect on walking and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in an ethnically-diverse sample. However, given the lack of comparable research contact in the control group, these findings should be taken cautiously.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dunton Genevieve Fridlund; Robertson Trina P; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.YPMED.2008.10.004","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dunton Genevieve Fridlund, and Robertson Trina P (2008) A tailored internet-plus-email intervention for increasing physical activity among ethnically-diverse women.

preschool years offer an opportunity to interrupt the trajectory toward obesity in black children. The Hip-Hop to Health Jr. Obesity Prevention Effectiveness Trial was a group-randomized controlled trial assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of a teacher-delivered weight control intervention for black preschool children. The 618 participating children were enrolled in 18 schools administered by the Chicago Public Schools. Children enrolled in the nine schools randomized to the intervention group received a 14-week weight control intervention delivered by their classroom teachers. Children in the nine control schools received a general health intervention. Height and weight, physical activity, screen time, and diet data were collected at baseline and postintervention. At postintervention, children in the intervention schools engaged in more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) than children in the control schools (difference between adjusted group means = 7.46 min/day, P = 0.02). Also, children in the intervention group had less total screen time (-27.8 min/day, P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in BMI, BMI Z score, or dietary intake. It is feasible to adapt an obesity prevention program to be taught by classroom teachers. The intervention showed positive influences on physical activity and screen time, but not on diet. Measuring diet and physical activity in preschool children remains a challenge, and interventions delivered by classroom teachers require both intensive initial training and ongoing individualized supervision.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fitzgibbon Marian L; Stolley Melinda R; Schiffer Linda A; Braunschweig Carol L; Gomez Sandra L; Van Horn Linda ; Dyer Alan R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/OBY.2010.314","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fitzgibbon Marian L, Stolley Melinda R, Schiffer Linda A, Braunschweig Carol L, Gomez Sandra L, Van Horn Linda, and Dyer Alan R (2011) Hip-Hop to Health Jr. Obesity Prevention Effectiveness Trial: postintervention results..

 The effectiveness of clinical–community linkages for promotion of physical activity (PA) has not been explored in low- and middle-income countries. This study assessed the effectiveness of a primary care–based, 16-week intervention rooted in behavioral theory approaches to increase compliance with aerobic PA recommendations.  Study design  Pragmatic cluster randomized trial.  Setting/participants  Patients had diagnosed (  Intervention  Each center was randomized to a brief PA counseling (BC,  n =2) or an exercise referral (ER,  n =2) intervention. The study was conducted between 2011 and 2012.  Main outcome measures  Change in objectively measured PA levels (ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers) at baseline, 16, and 24 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses were used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention overall and according to ER intervention attendance. Longitudinal multilevel mixed-effects analyses considering the interaction (time by intervention) were conducted. Each model was also adjusted by baseline value of the outcome measure, demographic and health variables, social support, PA self-efficacy, and barriers.  Results  Minutes/week of objectively measured moderate to vigorous PA increased by 40 and 53 minutes in the ER and BC groups, respectively ( p =0.59). Participants attending >50% of ER program sessions increased their moderate to vigorous PA by 104 minutes/week and compliance with aerobic PA recommendations by 23.8%, versus the BC group (both  p   Conclusions  Both BC and ER led to modest improvements in PA levels, with no significant differences between groups. Adequate adherence with the ER program sessions led to significant improvements in compliance with aerobic PA recommendations versus BC. These results can help guide development and implementation of programs integrating standardized PA assessment, counseling, and referrals via clinical–community linkages in Mexico and other low- and middle-income countries in the region.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gallegos-Carrillo Katia ; Gallegos-Carrillo Katia ; García-Peña Carmen ; Salmerón Jorge ; Salgado-de-Snyder Nelly ; Lobelo Felipe ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.AMEPRE.2016.10.021","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gallegos-Carrillo Katia, Gallegos-Carrillo Katia, García-Peña Carmen, Salmerón Jorge, Salgado-de-Snyder Nelly, and Lobelo Felipe (2017) Brief Counseling and Exercise Referral Scheme: A Pragmatic Trial in Mexico.

examined the effects of a family-based health promotion intervention on the moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light physical activity, sedentary behavior, and fruit and vegetable intake of African American parents. Eighty-nine African American parents (41.5 ± 8.5 years; 92% females; 74% obese; 64% < $40 K income) and adolescents (12.5 ± 1.4 years; 61% girls; 48% obese) were randomized to a 6-week behavioral skills plus positive parenting and peer monitoring intervention grounded in social cognitive, self-determination, and family systems theories or a general health comparison program. Parents wore accelerometers for 7 days and completed three 24-h dietary recalls at baseline and post-intervention. Multilevel regression models (controlling for baseline variables) demonstrated a significantly greater increase in parent MVPA for those in the intervention versus comparison condition (b = 9.44, SE = 4.26, p < 0.05). There were no other significant effects. Family-based approaches that include African American parents and youth may increase parent MVPA and hold promise for preventing chronic diseases.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"George Sara M.

Method: Inactive older adults (N = 38, 68 ± 7 years old, 71% female) were randomized to 12-week interventions targeting decreased sedentary behavior (Sit Less) or increased MVPA (Get Active). The SenseWear armband was used to objectively assess activity in real time. Assessments included a blinded armband, the Community Health Activites Model Program for Senior (CHAMPS) questionnaire, 400-meter walk, and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Results: Objectively measured MVPA increased in Get Active (75 ± 22 min/week, p   .05). Only the Sit Less group improved the SPPB score (0.5 ± 0.3, p = .046).

One way in which ABT may improve outcomes is through increasing physical activity (PA) intentions and behavior but little research has examined these as mediators of ABT on weight change. PURPOSE This study sought to examine ABT's effects on intentions for PA and several objectively measured PA variables during treatment and analyze PA intentions and behaviors as mediators of ABT's effect on weight loss. METHODS Participants (N = 189) with overweight/obesity randomized to 1 year of either ABT or SBT completed ecological momentary assessment of PA intentions, accelerometer-based PA assessment, and had weight measured at baseline, mid-treatment, and end of treatment. RESULTS ABT had a significantly higher increase than SBT in PA intention minutes at mid-treatment and end of treatment (p < 0.001), and both groups had nonlinear increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) that were not significantly different. Sequential mediation models found that ABT's effect on weight loss was partially mediated by higher PA intention minutes at mid-treatment leading to increased MVPA minutes per week. Increased MVPA minutes were obtained by participants increasing the number of days with MVPA bouts. CONCLUSIONS ABT's effect on weight loss throughout treatment resulted, in part, from participants increasing their intentions for PA.

IMPACT was a behavioral theory-based 1 1/2 year randomized controlled field study aimed at increasing bone accretion in middle school girls. The objective of this study was to determine the intervention effects of the IMPACT program upon key physical and sedentary activity endpoints among schools that participated in the IMPACT study. Endpoints examined included weight bearing physical activity (WBPA); moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA); vigorous physical activity (VPA); MET (metabolic equivalent) - weighted WBPA and MVPA; sedentary activity; before/after-school physical activity; and weekend physical activity. METHODS: Primary data analysis using a pretest-posttest control group design was conducted utilizing mixed model analysis of covariance. Data gathered from the IMPACT cohort from 2000-2002 were analyzed to determine baseline versus follow-up differences in activity endpoints. Confounders investigated included ethnicity, body mass index, menarcheal status, participation in 7th grade PE/athletics, friend/familial support and neighborhood safety. RESULTS: Follow-up means were higher for participating intervention schools relative to control schools for all physical activity variables but were statistically significant only for the following variables: daily minutes of vigorous physical activity (mean difference between Intervention (I) and Control (C) = 6.00 upward arrow minutes, 95% CI = 5.82-6.18, p = 0.05), daily after school activity minutes (mean difference between I and C = 8.95 upward arrow minutes, 95% CI = 8.69-9.21, p = 0.04), and daily weekend activity minutes (mean difference between I and C = 19.00 upward arrow minutes, 95% CI = 18.40-19.60, p = 0.05). The intervention significantly reduced duration of student daily TV/Video watching (mean difference between I and C = 12.11 downward arrow minutes, 95% CI = 11.74-12.48, p = 0.05) and total daily sedentary activity minutes (mean difference between I and C = 16.99 downward arrow minutes, 95% CI = 16.49-17.50, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: A well designed and implemented school based health and physical activity intervention can result in a positive influence upon increasing physical activity levels and decreasing sedentary activity. Future interventions should consider a more structured intervention component to obtain significant changes in WBPA.","Comments":"1479-5868 Jones, Desiree Hoelscher, Deanna M Kelder, Steven H Hergenroeder, Albert Sharma, Shreela V R01 HD037767/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States Journal Article England Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act. 2008 Aug 21;5:42. doi: 10.1186/1479-5868-5-42.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jones D ; Hoelscher D M; Kelder S H; Hergenroeder A ; Sharma S V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1479-5868-5-42","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jones D, Hoelscher D M, Kelder S H, Hergenroeder A, and Sharma S V (2008) Increasing physical activity and decreasing sedentary activity in adolescent girls--the Incorporating More Physical Activity and Calcium in Teens (IMPACT) study.

adults are the least active population group. Interventions in residential settings may support a multi-level approach to behavior change. In a cluster randomized control trial, 11 San Diego retirement communities were assigned to a physical activity (PA) intervention or a healthy aging attention control condition. Participants were 307 adults over 65 years old. The multilevel PA intervention was delivered with the assistance of peer leaders, who were trained older adult from the retirement communities. Intervention components included individual counseling & self-monitoring with pedometers, group education sessions, group walks, community advocacy and pedestrian community change projects. Intervention condition by time interactions were tested using generalized mixed effects regressions. The primary outcomes was accelerometer measured physical activity. Secondary outcomes were blood pressure and objectively measured physical functioning. Over 70% of the sample were 80 years or older. PA significantly increased in the intervention condition (56 min of moderate-vigorous PA per week; 119 min of light PA) compared with the control condition and remained significantly higher across the 12 month study. Men and participants under 84 years old benefited most from the intervention. There was a significant decrease in systolic (p < .007) and diastolic (p < .02) blood pressure at 6 months. Physical functioning improved but the changes were not statistically significant. Intervention fidelity was high demonstrating feasibility. Changes in PA and blood pressure achieved were comparable to other studies with much younger participants. Men, in particular, avoided a year-long decline in PA. clincialtrials.gov Identifier:                     NCT01155011\n                                      .","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kerr Jacqueline ; Rosenberg Dori ; Millstein Rachel A; Bolling Khalisa ; Crist Katie ; Takemoto Michelle ; Godbole Suneeta ; Moran Kevin ; Natarajan Loki ; Castro-Sweet Cynthia ; Buchner David ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/S12966-018-0658-4","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kerr Jacqueline, Rosenberg Dori, Millstein Rachel A, Bolling Khalisa, Crist Katie, Takemoto Michelle, Godbole Suneeta, Moran Kevin, Natarajan Loki, Castro-Sweet Cynthia, and Buchner David (2018) Cluster randomized controlled trial of a multilevel physical activity intervention for older adults..

This study examines the effectiveness and the mechanisms of a combined planning and self-efficacy intervention to promote physical activity among motivated individuals. Participants (N = 883) were randomly assigned to the intervention or to a waiting-list control condition. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the intervention resulted in significantly more physical activity, higher levels of action planning, coping planning, and volitional self-efficacy beliefs (p < 0.01). In addition, multiple mediation analysis showed that action planning, coping planning, and volitional self-efficacy mediate between the intervention and physical activity. The study shows that the intervention successfully fostered physical activity and unfolds the underlying self-regulatory mechanisms of the intervention's effectiveness.","Comments":"1465-3966 Koring, Milena Richert, Jana Parschau, Linda Ernsting, Anna Lippke, Sonia Schwarzer, Ralf Journal Article Randomized Controlled Trial England Psychol Health Med. 2012;17(4):488-98. doi: 10.1080/13548506.2011.608809.

Interventions are needed to address disparities in this high-risk group.  Purpose  To evaluate the efficacy of a culturally adapted, Spanish-language, individually tailored, computer expert system–driven physical activity print-based intervention for adult Latinas.  Design  RCT.  Setting/participants  Participants were 266 inactive adult Latinas who participated between 2009 and 2012.  Intervention  Participants were randomized to one of two treatment arms: a 6-month tailored physical activity intervention condition or wellness contact control. For both conditions, print materials were delivered by mail.  Main outcome measures  The main outcome measure was change in weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) measured by the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall interview, which was administered at baseline and post-intervention (6 months). Participants also wore accelerometers for a week at baseline and follow-up. Analyses were conducted in 2013.  Results  Increases in minutes/week of MVPA measured by the 7-Day PAR were significantly greater in the intervention group compared to the control group (mean difference=41.36, SE=7.93,  p  p  p 's  Conclusions  The tailored Spanish-language intervention was effective in increasing MVPA among predominantly low-income, less-acculturated Latinas. Such print-based interventions are poised for widespread dissemination, and thus may help address health disparities.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Marcus Bess H; Dunsiger Shira I; Pekmezi Dorothy W; Larsen Britta A; Bock Beth C; Gans Kim M; Marquez Becky ; Morrow Kathleen M; Tilkemeier Peter ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.AMEPRE.2013.07.006","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Marcus Bess H, Dunsiger Shira I, Pekmezi Dorothy W, Larsen Britta A, Bock Beth C, Gans Kim M, Marquez Becky, Morrow Kathleen M, and Tilkemeier Peter (2013) The Seamos Saludables Study: A Randomized Controlled Physical Activity Trial of Latinas.

To assess a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to improve moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in adolescents with congenital heart disease.  Methods  Intervention participants received one-on-one telephone-based adapted MI sessions over 3 months. Outcomes were acceptability, change mechanisms (stage of change and self-efficacy), and limited efficacy (physical activity, fitness, and quality of life).  Results  Thirty-six participants were randomized. Intervention participants completed 4.2 ± 1.2/6 MI sessions, with no improvements in the high self-efficacy or stage of change observed. Participants accumulated 47.24 ± 16.36 minutes of MVPA/day, and had comparable outcomes to peers without heart disease (except for functional capacity). There was no significant difference in change in any outcome by group.  Conclusions  The intervention was acceptable, but effectiveness could not be determined due to the nature and size of sample.  Clinical relevance  Pediatric cardiac rehabilitation remains the sole effective intervention to increase MVPA in this population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McKillop Adam ; Grace Sherry L; de Melo Ghisi Gabriela Lima; Allison Kenneth R; Banks Laura ; Kovacs Adrienne H; Schneiderman Jane E; McCrindle Brian W; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/PEP.0000000000000534","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McKillop Adam, Grace Sherry L, de Melo Ghisi Gabriela Lima, Allison Kenneth R, Banks Laura, Kovacs Adrienne H, Schneiderman Jane E, and McCrindle Brian W (2018) Adapted Motivational Interviewing to Promote Exercise in Adolescents With Congenital Heart Disease: A Pilot Trial..

activity has emerged as an important lifestyle factor for primary prevention of numerous diseases, including postmenopausal breast cancer. No study to date has assessed the acute and long-term effects of year-long aerobic exercise programs differing in prescribed exercise volume on physical activity and sedentary time in postmenopausal women. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effects of two moderate-vigorous intensity exercise doses on total, light and moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity times, and sedentary time in postmenopausal women during the year-long intervention and one year later. The Breast Cancer and Exercise Trial in Alberta (BETA) was a two-center, two-arm, 12-month randomized controlled trial that included 400 previously inactive postmenopausal women randomized to either 150 (MODERATE) or 300 (HIGH) minutes/week of aerobic exercise. Physical activity and sedentary time were assessed at baseline, 6- (intervention mid-point), 12- (prior to end of intervention) and 24-months (follow-up) with waist-mounted accelerometers (Actigraph GTX3®). Self-reported activity and sedentary time at baseline, 12- and 24-months was also assessed (Past Year Total Physical Activity Questionnaire and SIT-Q). Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted using linear mixed models and adjusted for baseline variables. Both physical activity interventions led to increases in objective and subjective measures of total and moderate-vigorous intensity/recreational physical activity time, coupled with decreases in sedentary time, at 6- and 12-months compared to baseline. Additionally, greater increases in accelerometry-derived total physical activity time at 6- and 12-months, and self-reported recreational activity time at 12-months, compared to baseline were noted in the HIGH versus MODERATE groups. Decreases in total, light and moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity time, and an increase in sedentary time, in both groups were noted at 24-months compared to 12-months. A decrease in light intensity physical activity time in both groups at 24-months compared to baseline was also noted. These findings have important health implications, suggesting that total physical activity time can be increased with greater volumes of prescribed exercise, but that additional support and resources could be used to promote the maintenance of these high levels of aerobic exercise participation following study completion. clinicaltrials.gov identifier:                     NCT01435005\n                                       (BETA Trial).

Random allocation to treatment or control conditions was at the school level. Study staff walked with children to and from school up to 5 days/week. Outcomes were measured the week before (time 1) and during weeks 4 and 5 of the intervention (time 2). The main outcome was the weekly rate of active commuting, and a secondary outcome was moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Covariates included sociodemographics, distance from home to school, neighborhood safety, child BMI z score, parent self-efficacy/outcome expectations, and child self-efficacy for active commuting. A mixed-model repeated measures regression accounted for clustering by school, and stepwise procedures with backward elimination of nonsignificant covariates were used to identify significant predictors. Results: Intervention children increased active commuting (mean ± SD) from 23.8% ± 9.2% (time 1) to 54% ± 9.2% (time 2), whereas control subjects decreased from 40.2% ± 8.9% (time 1) to 32.6% ± 8.9% (time 2) (P Language: en","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mendoza Jason A; Watson Kathy ; Baranowski Tom ; Nicklas Theresa A; Uscanga Doris K; Hanfling Marcus J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1542/PEDS.2010-3486","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mendoza Jason A, Watson Kathy, Baranowski Tom, Nicklas Theresa A, Uscanga Doris K, and Hanfling Marcus J (2011) The Walking School Bus and Children's Physical Activity: A Pilot Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.

A randomized controlled community trial was conducted at two units of the Health Academy Program (HAP; a service provided by PHC), which were randomly assigned either to control group (CG) or intervention group (IG). Participants in both groups (CG = 156 and IG = 135) took part in physical activity classes provided by HAP facilities with those in IG also participating in the VAMOS strategy for 12 weeks. This strategy is based on social cognitive theory. The main behavioral constructs addressed were self-efficacy, goal setting, self-monitoring, identification of social support and barriers, and solutions for the identified barriers. Physical activity was measured with accelerometers, and nutritional status was assessed using dietary habits questionnaires and anthropometric measurements. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed that participants in IG increased the daily time of moderate-vigorous PA and the frequency of raw vegetable intake, while the intake of ultra-processed foods was reduced. Weight loss among participants who were classified as overweight/obese at baseline was observed in the intervention group compared to control. These results suggest that the VAMOS strategy was effective in increasing PA, healthy dietary habits, and decreasing weight among PHC users. Therefore, VAMOS could be used as a strategy to strengthen individuals' autonomy regarding healthy choices and improve their overall health.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Meurer Simone Teresinha; Meurer Simone Teresinha; Lopes Aline Cristine Souza; Almeida Fabio Araujo; de Deus Mendonça Raquel ; Benedetti Tânia Rosane Bertoldo; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/1090198118820095","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Meurer Simone Teresinha, Meurer Simone Teresinha, Lopes Aline Cristine Souza, Almeida Fabio Araujo, de Deus Mendonça Raquel, and Benedetti Tânia Rosane Bertoldo (2019) Effectiveness of the VAMOS Strategy for Increasing Physical Activity and Healthy Dietary Habits: A Randomized Controlled Community Trial..

Evidence suggests youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have lower levels of physical activity (PA) than the general population. The ActivPals intervention aimed to support youth with T1D to lead an active lifestyle. METHODS Twenty youth aged 7 to 16 years with T1D were recruited to a pilot randomized controlled trial. PA and quality of life (QoL) were measured using Actigraph GT3X+ monitor and Pediatric QoL scales at baseline and 1-month follow-up. A two-way, mixed ANOVA showed indicative effects of the intervention. Qualitative interviews were carried out with 16 participants to explore perceptions of the intervention. RESULTS An increase in moderate to vigorous PA was reported in intervention and control groups from baseline to follow-up (F(1, 14) = 5.83; P = .03), with no significance between group differences. Participants in both groups reported significantly less overall diabetes \"problems\" (F(1, 16) = 7.93; P = .012) and significantly less lifestyle \"problems\" (F(1, 16) = 7.39; P = .015) at follow-up. However, both groups also reported significant increases in \"problems\" with the day-to-day diabetes routine (F(1,16) = 6.48; P = .022) at follow-up. Parents reported significant increased worry about their child's diabetes at follow-up, in both groups (F(1, 14) = 5.83; P = .046). There was no significant increase in reported hypoglycemic occurrences despite increased PA. The qualitative data highlight that goal setting, self-monitoring, and social support were effective motivators for increasing PA. CONCLUSIONS A larger trial with longer follow-up should be conducted to explore the effect of the intervention on PA in youth with T1D.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mitchell Fiona ; Wilkie Louise ; Robertson Kenneth ; Reilly John J; Kirk Alison ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/PEDI.12615","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mitchell Fiona, Wilkie Louise, Robertson Kenneth, Reilly John J, and Kirk Alison (2018) Feasibility and pilot study of an intervention to support active lifestyles in youth with type 1 diabetes: The ActivPals study..

Minutes of moderate/vigorous PA increased significantly in the PAC group (from 57.1±99.3 to 126.6±142.9 min/wk) but not in the UC group (from 60.2±116.1 to 69.6±116.1 min/wk, P<.001). Changes in other functional/disability outcomes were small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: In this group of older male veterans, multicomponent PA significantly improved rapid gait and PA. Translation from increased PA to overall functioning was not observed. Integration with primary care was successful.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morey Miriam C; Peterson Matthew J; Pieper Carl F; Sloane Richard ; Crowley Gail M; Cowper Patricia A; McConnell Eleanor S; Bosworth Hayden B; Ekelund Carola C; Pearson Megan P; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/J.1532-5415.2009.02301.X","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Morey Miriam C, Peterson Matthew J, Pieper Carl F, Sloane Richard, Crowley Gail M, Cowper Patricia A, McConnell Eleanor S, Bosworth Hayden B, Ekelund Carola C, and Pearson Megan P (2009) The Veterans Learning to Improve Fitness and Function in Elders Study: A Randomized Trial of Primary Care–Based Physical Activity Counseling For Older Men.

15% of U.S. adults achieve adequate activity. This study is an experimental repeated measures nested design randomizing two similar rural communities to investigate the effectiveness of the Heart and Soul Physical Activity Program (HSPAP) (Peterson, 2002) in promoting physical activity in midlife women (n=42) aged 35 to 65 years. The HSPAP, an innovative church-based health promotion intervention, is conceptualized in social support and designed to increase physical activity, energy expenditure (EE), and cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 max), measured over time. A significant interaction (p<.001) was found for EE in one HSPAP group increasing their EE by 1,010 kcals/week. HSPAP participants increased their VO2 max level by 75% (p<.001) and 10%; comparison groups stayed the same or declined 16%. Study results provide preliminary support for the HSPAP intervention as an effective treatment to improve physical activity levels in sedentary, rural, midlife women.","Comments":"Peterson, Jane Anthony Yates, Bernice C Atwood, Jan R Hertzog, Melody Clinical Trial Multicenter Study Randomized Controlled Trial Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States West J Nurs Res. 2005 Feb;27(1):93-110. doi: 10.1177/0193945904270912.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Peterson J A; Yates B C; Atwood J R; Hertzog M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0193945904270912","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nChristianity\r\nEnergy Metabolism\r\nExercise Test\r\nExercise Therapy/ organization & administration\r\nFemale\r\nHealth Promotion\r\nHumans\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMidwestern United States\r\nNursing Evaluation Research\r\nPhysical Fitness\r\nProgram Evaluation\r\nRural Health Services/ organization & administration\r\nSocial Support\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nWomen's Health\r\nWomen's Health Services/ organization & administration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Peterson J A, Yates B C, Atwood J R, and Hertzog M (2005) Effects of a physical activity intervention for women.

METHODS: Forty-one sedentary women with stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer currently receiving hormonal therapy were randomly assigned to receive the 12-week Better Exercise Adherence after Treatment for Cancer intervention or usual care. Assessments occurred at baseline, postintervention, and 3 months postintervention. RESULTS: Weekly minutes of greater than or equal to moderate intensity physical activity measured by accelerometer showed a significant group by time interaction (F = 3.51; P = 0.035; between group difference in the mean change from baseline to 3 months postintervention, 100.1 minute, P = 0.012). Significant group by time interactions also showed sustained improvements from baseline to 3 months postintervention in strength (F = 3.82; P = 0.027; between group difference, 11.2 kg; P = 0.026), waist-to-hip ratio (F = 3.36; P = 0.041; between group difference, -0.04; P = 0.094), and social well-being (F = 4.22; P = 0.023; between group difference, 3.9; P = 0.039). A delayed reduction in lower extremity dysfunction 3 months postintervention was noted (F = 3.24; P = 0.045; between group difference in the mean change from postintervention to 3 months follow-up; P = -7.6; P = 0.015). No group by time effect was noted for fitness, body mass index, percent fat, bone density, total quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General), fatigue, endocrine symptoms, cognitive function, or sleep. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention resulted in sustained improvements in physical activity, strength, central adiposity, and social well-being with lower extremity function benefits appearing 3 months after intervention completion. Testing translation in a multisite study is warranted.","Comments":"Rogers, Laura Q Hopkins-Price, Patricia Vicari, Sandy Markwell, Stephen Pamenter, Richard Courneya, Kerry S Hoelzer, Karen Naritoku, Catherine Edson, Billie Jones, Linda Dunnington, Gary Verhulst, Steven Journal Article Randomized Controlled Trial Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't United States Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2009 May;18(5):1410-8. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-1045.

U.S. adults are insufficiently active. One strategy individuals could use to increase physical activity is to exercise mindfully (i.e., while paying attention to present-moment experiences with acceptance (1,2)). A mindfulness-based intervention for exercise can be delivered via an audio recording, which is advantageous in regard to time demands, cost, and dissemination potential. The aims of this parallel two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an audio-recorded mindfulness-based intervention and to assess whether the intervention resulted in a clinically meaningful difference in physical activity compared to the control condition. METHODS Physically underactive adults (N = 50) were randomized to a mindfulness intervention condition in which they were instructed to exercise while listening to an audio-recorded mindfulness-intervention or an active control group in which they were instructed to exercise while using a heart rate monitor. Participants completed a 30-minute moderate intensity treadmill exercise bout during a baseline in-lab session in the manner in which they were randomized (i.e., mindfulness recording vs. using a heart-rate monitor), and instructed to exercise in this manner for the next week. At follow-up, acceptability was measured by self-report, feasibility by frequency of intervention use, and physical activity using both self-reported physical activity recall and an accelerometer. RESULTS The audio-recorded mindfulness-based physical activity intervention was rated as acceptable and feasible to use. Compared to the control group, the intervention also resulted in clinically meaningful differences in self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) minutes (M difference = 67.16 minutes) and accelerometer-measured minutes (M difference = 35.48 minutes) during a one-week follow-up. CONCLUSION The audio-recorded mindfulness-based physical activity intervention is a promising approach to increasing physical activity with good dissemination potential.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sala Margaret ; Geary Bree ; Baldwin Austin S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0000000000000885","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sala Margaret, Geary Bree, and Baldwin Austin S (2020) A Mindfulness-Based Physical Activity Intervention: A Randomized Pilot Study..

Aim: To analyse an intervention based on play as a means of improving the body composition of children who are overweight or obese. Methods: The Kids-Play study is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) consisting of 49 children aged 8–12 years on a nine-month intervention programme based on physical activity, play and nutritional advice. Controls had another 49 children, who received only nutritional advice. Results: The play-based intervention achieved a moderate-vigorous level of physical activity in the study group of 81.18 min per day, while the corresponding level for the control group was only 37.34 min. At the start of the intervention, the children in the study group had an average body fat content of 41.66%, a level that decreased to 38.85% by the end of the programme. Among the control group, body fat increased from 38.83% to 41.4% during the same period. Conclusions: The intervention programme considered, based on both play and nutritional recommendations, produced a decrease in body fat among children aged 8–12 years. However, the control group, which received only nutritional recommendations, experienced an increase in body weight.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sánchez-López Antonio Manuel; Menor-Rodríguez María José; Sánchez-García Juan Carlos; Aguilar-Cordero María José; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/IJERPH17010346","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sánchez-López Antonio Manuel, Menor-Rodríguez María José, Sánchez-García Juan Carlos, and Aguilar-Cordero María José (2020) Play as a Method to Reduce Overweight and Obesity in Children: An RCT.

The core intervention component was physically active academic lessons, a teaching activity that combines physical activity and educational content. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a 10-month, cluster-randomized controlled trial on physical activity level and aerobic fitness conducted in the city of Stavanger, Norway, in 2014–15. The physical activity level during physically active academic lessons was also studied. A total of 447 children (9–10 years) participated. The weekly intervention consisted of physically active academic lessons, physically active homework and physically active recess. Physical activity level and aerobic fitness were measured objectively by accelerometry and a 10-minute interval running test. Intervention effects were found for time in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (adjusted mean difference of 8 min/day, 95% CI: 3.4–13, p  Clinicaltrail.gov  ID identifier: NCT03436355.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Seljebotn Per Helge; Skage Ingrid ; Riskedal Anette ; Olsen Marta ; Kvalø Silje Eikanger; Dyrstad Sindre Mikal; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.PMEDR.2018.12.009","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Seljebotn Per Helge, Skage Ingrid, Riskedal Anette, Olsen Marta, Kvalø Silje Eikanger, and Dyrstad Sindre Mikal (2019) Physically active academic lessons and effect on physical activity and aerobic fitness.

The intervention group received a behavioral intervention that used goal setting, time management, and self-monitoring to target dimensions of self-regulation and MVPA. The control received information regarding their PA habits. MVPA was measured via BodyMedia Armbands at pre- and post-test. The use of self-regulatory strategies for MVPA was assessed at pretest and posttest using the Self-Regulation for Exercise Scale. Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated to determine the practical impact of the intervention. The intervention had a large effect on all dimensions of self-regulation across time: including total self-regulation (3.15), self-monitoring (4.63), goal setting (3.17), social support (1.29), self-reward (1.98), time management (4.41), and overcoming barriers (2.25). The intervention had no impact on dimensions of MVPA across time. This pilot study demonstrated the ability of a behavioral intervention to improve the use of self-regulation strategies for MVPA in a sample of adults with type 2 diabetes. These findings can further inform the development of health promotion programs to promote self-regulation. Future research should focus on determining ability of improvements in self-regulation to stimulate behavior change.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Silfee Valerie ; Petosa Rick ; Laurent Devin ; Schaub Timothy ; Focht Brian ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/13548506.2016.1139144","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Silfee Valerie, Petosa Rick, Laurent Devin, Schaub Timothy, and Focht Brian (2016) Effect of a behavioral intervention on dimensions of self-regulation and physical activity among overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes: a pilot study..

change interventions are effective to the extent that they affect appropriately-measured outcomes, especially in experimental controlled trials. The primary goal of this study was to analyze the impact of a 1-year weight management intervention based on self-determination theory (SDT) on theory-based psychosocial mediators, physical activity/exercise, and body weight and composition. Participants were 239 women (37.6 ± 7.1 years; 31.5 ± 4.1 kg/m2) who received either an intervention focused on promoting autonomous forms of exercise regulation and intrinsic motivation, or a general health education program (controls). At 12 months, the intervention group showed increased weight loss (−7.29%,) and higher levels of physical activity/exercise (+138 ± 26 min/day of moderate plus vigorous exercise; +2,049 ± 571 steps/day), compared to controls (P < 0.001). Main intervention targets such as more autonomous self-regulation (for treatment and for exercise) and a more autonomous perceived treatment climate revealed large effect sizes (between 0.80 and .96), favoring intervention (P < 0.001). Results suggest that interventions grounded in SDT can be successfully implemented in the context of weight management, enhancing the internalization of more autonomous forms of behavioral regulation, and facilitating exercise adherence, while producing clinically-significant weight reduction, when compared to a control condition. Findings are fully consistent with previous studies conducted within this theoretical framework in other areas of health behavior change.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Silva Marlene N; Vieira Paulo N; Coutinho Sílvia R; Minderico Cláudia S; Matos Margarida G; Sardinha Luís B; Teixeira Pedro J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/S10865-009-9239-Y","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Silva Marlene N, Vieira Paulo N, Coutinho Sílvia R, Minderico Cláudia S, Matos Margarida G, Sardinha Luís B, and Teixeira Pedro J (2010) Using self-determination theory to promote physical activity and weight control: a randomized controlled trial in women.

Design: Fifty-two women with stage II + breast cancer who had recently (within the previous 7 days) completed a 12-week supervised exercise program were randomised to the PAC or PAC + F group. Methods: Physical activity levels, including weekly minutes of total physical activity (min/week), daily step count (steps/day), and weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA, min/week), were assessed using the Active Australia survey and Actigraph® GT3X+ accelerometers. Self-reported outcomes were assessed at baseline and 12-week follow-up, while objectively-measured outcomes were only available at 12-week follow-up. Results: Compared with the PAC group, the PAC + F group had higher self-reported MVPA and self-reported total activity (between-group mean difference: 78.2 [95% CI = −8.3, 164.9] min/week, p  80%) of the PAC + F group reported high levels of Fitbit use and considered the device to be beneficial for physical activity maintenance. Conclusions: Findings suggest that activity trackers show promise as an effective, feasible and acceptable approach to support physical activity maintenance following completion of a supervised exercise intervention. Trial registration: Prospectively registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR, Trial registration number: ACTRN12616000954426).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Singh Ben ; Spence Rosalind R; Sandler Carolina X; Tanner Jodie ; Hayes Sandra C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.JSAMS.2019.09.019","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Singh Ben, Spence Rosalind R, Sandler Carolina X, Tanner Jodie, and Hayes Sandra C (2020) Feasibility and effect of a physical activity counselling session with or without provision of an activity tracker on maintenance of physical activity in women with breast cancer — A randomised controlled trial.

We report the 12-month (midpoint) effects of a 2-year multicomponent physical activity intervention implemented in disadvantaged secondary schools.  Methods  A cluster randomised trial was undertaken in 10 secondary schools located in disadvantaged areas in New South Wales, Australia. Students in Grade 7 were recruited, with follow-up in Grade 8. The intervention was guided by socioecological theory and included seven physical activity strategies, and six implementation adoption strategies. The primary outcome was mean minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day assessed using Actigraph GT3X accelerometers. Outcome data were analysed using repeated measures linear mixed models.  Results  At baseline, 1150 (93%) students participated in the data collection (mean age 12 years, 48% boys) and 1050 (79%) students participated at 12-month follow-up. By the 12-month follow-up, the six implementation adoption strategies had been used to support schools to deliver four of the seven physical activity elements. There was a significant group-by-time interaction for mean minutes of MVPA per day in favour of the intervention group (adjusted difference between groups at follow-up=3.85 min, 95% CI (0.79 to 6.91), p≤0.01), including significantly more vigorous physical activity (2.45 min, p≤0.01), equating to 27 min more MVPA per week.  Summary  At 12-month follow-up, the intervention had reduced the decline in physical activity among adolescents from disadvantaged schools. The intervention may assist students to meet physical activity guidelines.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sutherland Rachel ; Campbell Elizabeth ; Lubans David R; Morgan Philip J; Okely Anthony D; Okely Anthony D; Nathan Nicole ; Wolfenden Luke ; Wiese Jarrod ; Gillham Karen ; Hollis Jenna ; Wiggers John ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1136/BJSPORTS-2014-094523","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sutherland Rachel, Campbell Elizabeth, Lubans David R, Morgan Philip J, Okely Anthony D, Okely Anthony D, Nathan Nicole, Wolfenden Luke, Wiese Jarrod, Gillham Karen, Hollis Jenna, and Wiggers John (2016) ‘Physical Activity 4 Everyone’ school-based intervention to prevent decline in adolescent physical activity levels: 12 month (mid-intervention) report on a cluster randomised trial.

This paper reports the effectiveness of an adapted efficacious school-based intervention in improving children’s moderate to vigorous physical activity. The impact of strategies to support program implementation was also assessed.    Design  A cluster RCT of low socioeconomic elementary schools in New South Wales, Australia.    Setting/participants  Consenting schools were randomized (25 intervention, 21 control) using a computerized random number function. Follow-up measures were taken at 6 months post-randomization (May–August 2015) by blinded research assistants. The multicomponent school-based intervention, based on an efficacious school-based physical activity program (Supporting Children’s Outcomes using Rewards, Exercise and Skills), consisted of four physical activity strategies and seven implementation support strategies. The intervention was adapted for scalability and delivery by a local health service over 6 months. The primary outcome was accelerometer assessed, student mean daily minutes spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity. Physical education lesson quality and other school physical activity practices were also assessed.    Results  Participants (n=1,139, 49% male) were third- through sixth-grade students at follow-up (May–August 2015). Valid wear time and analysis of data were provided for 989 (86%) participants (571 intervention, 568 control). At 6-month follow-up, there were no significant effects in overall daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity between groups (1.96 minutes, 95% CI= –3.49, 7.41, p=0.48). However, adjusted difference in mean minutes of overall vigorous physical activity (2.19, 95% CI=0.06, 4.32, p=0.04); mean minutes of school day moderate to vigorous physical activity (2.90, 95% CI=0.06, 5.85, p=0.05); and mean minutes of school day vigorous physical activity (1.81, 95% CI=0.78, 2.83, p≤0.01) were significantly different in favor of the intervention group. Physical education lesson quality and school physical activity practices were significantly different favoring the intervention group (analyzed October 2015–January 2016).    Conclusions  The modified intervention was not effective in increasing children’s overall daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity, when adapted for implementation at scale. However, the intervention did improve daily minutes of vigorous physical activity and school day moderate to vigorous physical activity, lesson quality, and school physical activity practices.

determine whether adding web-based support (e-coachER) to an exercise referral scheme (ERS) increases objectively assessed physical activity (PA).  Design  Multicentre trial with participants randomised to usual ERS alone (control) or usual ERS plus e-coachER (intervention).  Setting  Primary care and ERS in three UK sites from 2015 to 2018.  Participants  450 inactive ERS referees with chronic health conditions.  Interventions  Participants received a pedometer, PA recording sheets and a user guide for the web-based support. e-coachER interactively encouraged the use of the ERS and other PA options.  Main outcome measures  Primary and key secondary outcomes were: objective moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) minutes (in ≥10 min bouts and without bouts), respectively, after 12 months. Secondary outcomes were: other accelerometer-derived and self-reported PA measures, ERS attendance, EQ-5D-5L, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and beliefs about PA. All outcomes were collected at baseline, 4 and 12 months. Primary analysis was an intention to treat comparison between intervention and control arms at 12-month follow-up.  Results  There was no significant effect of the intervention on weekly MVPA at 12 months between the groups recorded in ≥10 min bouts (mean difference 11.8 min of MVPA, 95% CI: −2.1 to 26.0; p=0.10) or without bouts (mean difference 13.7 min of MVPA, 95% CI: −26.8 to 54.2; p=0.51) for 232 participants with usable data. There was no difference in the primary or secondary PA outcomes at 4 or 12 months.

However, the specific effects of active gaming when delivered within the context of a pediatric weight management program are unknown.  Objective  To evaluate the effects of active video gaming on physical activity and weight loss in children participating in an evidence-based weight management program delivered in the community.  Design, Setting, and Participants  Group-randomized clinical trial conducted during a 16-week period in YMCAs and schools located in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Texas. Seventy-five overweight or obese children (41 girls [55%], 34 whites [45%], 20 Hispanics [27%], and 17 blacks [23%]) enrolled in a community-based pediatric weight management program. Mean (SD) age of the participants was 10.0 (1.7) years; body mass index (BMI) z score, 2.15 (0.40); and percentage overweight from the median BMI for age and sex, 64.3% (19.9%).  Interventions  All participants received a comprehensive family-based pediatric weight management program (JOIN for ME). Participants in the program and active gaming group received hardware consisting of a game console and motion capture device and 1 active game at their second treatment session and a second game in week 9 of the program. Participants in the program-only group were given the hardware and 2 games at the completion of the 16-week program.  Main Outcomes and Measures  Objectively measured daily moderate-to-vigorous and vigorous physical activity, percentage overweight, and BMI z score.  Results  Participants in the program and active gaming group exhibited significant increases in moderate-to-vigorous (mean [SE], 7.4 [2.7] min/d) and vigorous (2.8 [0.9] min/d) physical activity at week 16 ( P  P  = .04) and vigorous (3.1 [1.3] min/d; P  = .02) physical activity. Participants in both groups exhibited significant reductions in percentage overweight and BMI z scores at week 16. However, the program and active gaming group exhibited significantly greater reductions in percentage overweight (mean [SE], −10.9% [1.6%] vs −5.5% [1.5%]; P  = .02) and BMI z score (−0.25 [0.03] vs −0.11 [0.03]; P   Conclusions and Relevance  Incorporating active video gaming into an evidence-based pediatric weight management program has positive effects on physical activity and relative weight.

If these sedentary behaviors continue over extended periods of time, there will be negative health consequences.\n\nObjective The objective of this study was to investigate the physical activity and health-related outcomes of teaching children with DS to ride a 2-wheel bicycle.\n\nDesign This study was a randomized intervention in which the control group waited 1 year to receive the intervention.\n\nSetting This intervention study was conducted in a community setting.\n\nParticipants The participants were children who were 8 to 15 years of age and who had been diagnosed with DS.\n\nIntervention The participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group (bicycle intervention) or a control group (no intervention).\n\nMeasurements Measurements were obtained in the month before the intervention (preintervention), at 7 weeks after the intervention, and at 12 months after the preintervention measurement for all participants.\n\nResults The results indicated no group differences at the preintervention session. Fifty-six percent of the participants in the experimental group successfully learned to ride a 2-wheel bicycle during the 5-day intervention. Analysis showed that participants who learned to ride spent significantly less time in sedentary activity at 12 months after the preintervention measurement and more time in moderate to vigorous physical activity than participants in the control group. Body fat appeared to be positively influenced over time in participants who learned to ride.\n\nLimitations It is unknown how frequently the children in the experimental group rode their bicycles after the intervention.\n\nConclusions Most children who are 8 to 15 years of age and who have been diagnosed with DS can learn to ride a 2-wheel bicycle. Learning to ride can reduce time spent in sedentary activity and increase time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity, which may influence the health and functioning of these children.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ulrich Dale A; Burghardt Amy R; Lloyd Meghann ; Tiernan Chad ; Hornyak Joseph E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2522/PTJ.20110061","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ulrich Dale A, Burghardt Amy R, Lloyd Meghann, Tiernan Chad, and Hornyak Joseph E (2011) Physical Activity Benefits of Learning to Ride a Two-Wheel Bicycle for Children With Down Syndrome: A Randomized Trial.

However, few older adults reach the health guideline of 150 min per week of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Electronic health (eHealth) interventions are effective in increasing PA levels in older adults in the short term but, rarely, intermediate-term effects after a period without the support of a website or an app have been examined. Furthermore, current theory-based interventions focus mainly on preintentional determinants, although postintentional determinants should also be included to increase the likelihood of successful behavior change. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the effect of the theory-based eHealth intervention, MyPlan 2.0, focusing on pre- and postintentional determinants on both accelerometer-based and self-reported PA levels in older Belgian adults in the short and intermediate term. METHODS This study was a randomized controlled trial with three data collection points: baseline (N=72), post (five weeks after baseline; N=65), and follow-up (three months after baseline; N=65). The study took place in Ghent, and older adults (aged ≥65 years) were recruited through a combination of random and convenience sampling. At all the time points, participants were visited by the research team. Self-reported domain-specific PA was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and accelerometers were used to objectively assess PA. Participants in the intervention group got access to the eHealth intervention, MyPlan 2.0, and used it independently for five consecutive weeks after baseline. MyPlan 2.0 was based on the self-regulatory theory and focused on both pre- and postintentional processes to increase PA. Multilevel mixed-models repeated measures analyses were performed in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). RESULTS Significant (borderline) positive intervention effects were found for accelerometer-based MVPA (baseline-follow-up: intervention group +5 min per day and control group -5 min per day; P=.07) and for accelerometer-based total PA (baseline-post: intervention group +20 min per day and control group -24 min per day; P=.05). MyPlan 2.0 was also effective in increasing self-reported PA, mainly in the intermediate term. A positive intermediate-term intervention effect was found for leisure-time vigorous PA (P=.02), moderate household-related PA (P=.01), and moderate PA in the garden (P=.04). Negative intermediate-term intervention effects were found for leisure-time moderate PA (P=.01) and cycling for transport (P=.07). CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that theory-based eHealth interventions focusing on pre- and postintentional determinants have the potential for behavior change in older adults. If future studies including larger samples and long-term follow-up can confirm and clarify these findings, researchers and practitioners should be encouraged to use a self-regulation perspective for eHealth intervention development.

Active Plus is a proven effective computer-tailored PA intervention for the older adult population focusing on PA in daily life. This manuscript describes the effects of the Active Plus intervention (N = 260) on PA of older adults with chronic illnesses (OACI), compared to a waiting list control group (N = 325). It was part of a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the effects of the Active Plus intervention on cognitive functioning. OACI (≥65 years) with at least one chronic illness were allocated to one of the conditions. Intervention group participants received PA advice. Baseline and follow-up measurements were assessed after 6 and 12 months. Intervention effects on objectively measured light PA (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) min/week were analysed with multilevel linear mixed-effects models adjusted for the clustered design. Intervention effects on self-reported MVPA min/week on common types of PA were analysed with two-part generalized linear mixed-effects models adjusted for the clustered design. The dropout rate was 19.1% after 6 months and 25.1% after 12 months. Analyses showed no effects on objectively measured PA. Active Plus increased the likelihood to perform self-reported cycling and gardening at six months and participants who cycled increased their MVPA min/week of cycling. Twelve months after baseline the intervention increased the likelihood to perform self-reported walking and participants who cycled at 12 months increased their MVPA min/week of cycling. Subgroup analyses showed that more vulnerable participants (higher degree of impairment, age or body mass index) benefitted more from the intervention on especially the lower intensity PA outcomes. In conclusion, Active Plus only increased PA behaviour to a limited extent in OACI 6 and 12 months after baseline measurements. The Active Plus intervention may yet be not effective enough by itself in OACI. A blended approach, where this eHealth intervention and face-to-face contact are combined, is advised to improve the effects of Active Plus on PA in this target group.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Volders Esmee ; Bolman Catherine A W; de Groot Renate H M; de Groot Renate H M; Verboon Peter ; Lechner Lilian ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/IJERPH17072590","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Volders Esmee, Bolman Catherine A W, de Groot Renate H M, de Groot Renate H M, Verboon Peter, and Lechner Lilian (2020) The Effect of Active Plus, a Computer-Tailored Physical Activity Intervention, on the Physical Activity of Older Adults with Chronic Illness(es) : A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.

Main Outcome Measure: The 7-dayphysical activity recall administered at baseline, Month 6, and Month 12, with outcomes operationalizedas percentage achieving 150 min/week of MVPA. Results: When controlling for covariates, there was anonsignificant trend in favor of the enhanced print condition reflecting 46% and 50% greater odds ofachieving 150 min/week of MVPA at Month 6 and Month 12, respectively.

DESIGN: The ACT program was a randomized controlled school-based trial testing the efficacy of a motivational plus behavioral skills intervention on increasing MVPA in underserved adolescents. Twenty-four middle schools were matched on school size, percentage minorities, percentage free or reduce lunch, and urban or rural setting before randomization. A total of 1,563 6th grade students (mean age, 11.3 years, 73% African American, 71% free or reduced lunch, 55% female) participated in either a 17-week (over one academic year) intervention or comparison after-school program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was MVPA based on 7-day accelerometry estimates at 2-weeks postintervention and an intermediate outcome was MVPA at midintervention. RESULTS: At midintervention students in the intervention condition engaged in 4.87 greater minutes of MVPA per day (95% CI: 1.18 to 8.57) than control students. Students in intervention schools engaged in 9.11 min (95% CI: 5.73 to 12.48) more of MVPA per day than those in control schools during the program time periods; indicating a 27 min per week increase in MVPA. No significant effect of the ACT intervention was found outside of school times or for MVPA at 2-weeks postintervention. CONCLUSIONS: Motivational and behavioral skills programs are effective at increasing MVPA in low-income and minority adolescents during program hours, but further research is needed to address home barriers to youth MVPA.","Comments":"1930-7810 Wilson, Dawn K Van Horn, M Lee Kitzman-Ulrich, Heather Saunders, Ruth Pate, Russell Lawman, Hannah G Hutto, Brent Griffin, Sarah Zarrett, Nicole Addy, Cheryl L Mansard, Leslie Mixon, Gary Brown, Porschia V F31 DK086358-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States R01 HD045693/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States R01 HD045693-05/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States R01 HD 045693/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States Journal Article Randomized Controlled Trial Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural United States Health Psychol. 2011 Jul;30(4):463-71. doi: 10.1037/a0023390.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wilson D K; Van Horn  ; M L ; Kitzman-Ulrich H ; Saunders R ; Pate R ; Lawman H G; Hutto B ; Griffin S ; Zarrett N ; Addy C L; Mansard L ; Mixon G ; Brown P V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1037/a0023390","Keywords":"Behavior Therapy\r\nChild\r\n*Choice Behavior\r\nExercise/*psychology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMinority Groups/*psychology\r\nMotivation\r\n*Motor Activity\r\nPoverty/*psychology\r\nSocial Environment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wilson D K, Van Horn , M L, Kitzman-Ulrich H, Saunders R, Pate R, Lawman H G, Hutto B, Griffin S, Zarrett N, Addy C L, Mansard L, Mixon G, and Brown P V (2011) Results of the \"Active by Choice Today\" (ACT) randomized trial for increasing physical activity in low-income and minority adolescents.
