## Description
The project takes as input pdfs (scientific articles of behavioural change) and return several attributes encoded in the behavioural change ontology developed by UCL in the context of the HBCP project (https://www.humanbehaviourchange.org/).
A rest API with a Swagger UI is provided.

Examples of extracted attributes:

Features of the population of the study:
- minimun age 
- max age
- gender

Behavioral Change Intervention described in the study:
- goal settings
- problem solving
- ...

## Requirements
Most recent version of Maven: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
