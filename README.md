### Note:
Please consider that this is a work in progress and we are currently working on improving/expanding the project.
Feel free to download the code and use it, as well as to send us feedback and bug report.


## Description
The project takes as input pdfs (scientific articles of behavioural change) and return several attributes encoded in the behavioural change ontology developed by UCL in the context of the HBCP project (https://www.humanbehaviourchange.org/).
A rest API with a Swagger UI is provided. This allow everybody to test the system from a web browser: [http://23.97.177.82:8180/swagger-ui.html](http://23.97.177.82:8180/swagger-ui.html)
 
Supported entities for the moment:
Population caractheristics: min age, max age, gender and mean age.

Behavioral Change Intervention: Goal Setting (Behaviour), Problem Solving, Action Planning, Feedback on behaviour, Self-monitoring of behaviour, Social support (unspecified), Information about health consequences, Information about social and Pharmacological support environmental consequences and Reduce negative emotions.


## Requirements
Most recent version of Maven: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

## What has been released in this repository

We are releasing:
- code for supervised, semisupervised and unsupersived retrieval of a selection of BCTs
- Swagger api facilities
- Java documentation for each class
- 17 fully annotated open access papers

## Dataset
In the context of the [HBCP] (https://www.humanbehaviourchange.org/), 244 papers of behavior science literature have been anontated for 10 behavioral change techniques and 4 population caractheristics ( min age, max age, mean age and gender) according to the BCI Ontology. 
Our pre-trained model is trained on a subset of 111 papers.
We release 17 papers (that the model has not been trained on) as a sample dataset. Those 17 papers are open access and publily avaliable.


## Quickstart


### Running the project
To run the project, simply type from your command-line.
```
sh scripts/hbcpie.sh
```

In case you're working on windows, type the following command to index the collection.
```
mvn exec:java@indexer
```

The next step is to execute the following command to run the IE pipeline.
```
mvn exec:java@extractor
```


## Test REST API with Swagger UI
The project uses spring boot and spring fox with swagger ui. 

From the command line, locate yourself in the project HOME (hbcpIE/) and execute
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Open a browser and hit this [URL] (http://localhost:8180/swagger-ui.html)
